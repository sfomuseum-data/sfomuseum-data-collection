      "International Tributes to the History of Flight\nBalfo Crosses the South Atlantic\nItalo Balbo, Italy's Minister of Aviation, organized\none of aviation's most well-known flights in 1930.\nUnlike many previous aviation feats, this was a group\nrather than a solo effort. Balbo orchestrated the for-\nmation flight of 14 Savoia-Marchetti S-55A flying boats\nacross the South Atlantic. This well-planned event\ndrew attention to Italy as a major force in the world\nof aviation. The flight, which began on December 17,\n1930, took these Italian aircraft and their pilots from\nOrbetello (north of Rome) to Spain, Morocco, Por-\ntuguese Guinea, and Brazil. On January 16, 1931, the\nplanes arrived in Rio de Janiero, their final destination.\nWhile only 11 of the 14 aircraft actually made the\nentire flight, the Savoia-Marchetti proved to be a\nviable commercial aircraft and Italy showed the world\nits commitment to the development of international\nflight routes.\nThe full-color cachet shows the array of colors used\nto paint the hulls of the planes in this flying armada.\nThe formation mirrored Italy's flag by combining red,\ngreen, and white painted hulls.\nMint stamp: The mint stamp on this Cover was issued\nby the Republic of Chad in 1978. It portrays the twin-\nhulled seaplane used by Balbo for this historic South\nAtlantic crossing.\nPostmark: This Cover was postmarked in Rome, near\nOrbetello, Italy, on December 17, 1983, marking the\nanniversary of the beginning of this historic flight.\n© Postal Commemorative Society\nPrinted in U.S.A.\n2019.056.031"
