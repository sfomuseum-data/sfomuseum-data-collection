Lindbergh from\nNew\nYork to Paris and\nnow a vice-\npresident of\nPan-American Air-\nways, working in cooperation with\nexecutives of the China National\nAviation Corporation,\nin\nwhich\nthe Pan-American and the Chinese\nNational Government are partners.\nBixby is presently in Manila ne-\ngotiating for the franchise with\nthe Philippine legislature for the\nservice from Hongkong to Manila.\nThe inauguration of the Shang-\nhai-Canton air mail\nline took\nplace with the departure from the\nLunghwa airport here at 6:02 o'-\nclock this morning of the giant Si-\nkorsky amphibian plane for\nCan-\nton.\nThe plane carried 500 letters\nand packages and was piloted by\nR. H. Gast, with H. Woods as co-\npilot.\nW. S. Grooch, manager of\nthe China National Aviation Com-\npany, was aboard.\nAt 9:30 a. m. the plane passed\nover Wenchow.\nThe Sikorsky was scheduled to\narrive at Canton at 5 o'clock this\nafternoon. It will lie over at Can-\nton until 2:30 p. m.\ntomorrow,\nwhen it will leave for Swatow, ar-\nriving at that city at 5:20 p. m.\nand leaving there at 6:15 a. m. on\nOctober 26,\nreaching Shanghai\nagain at 3 p. m. of the same day.\nThe new service will assure re-\nceivers of air mail at Canton that\ntheit replies wested ay, can on at\nShanghai on Thursday afternoon,\nThe second schedule of each\nweek will be started from Shang-\nhai on Friday morning, the plane\nreturning to this city on Saturday\nafternoon.\nDuring the first 30 days of its\noperation the line will carry mails\nonly, thus giving the company an\nopportunity to make arrangements\nfor the handling of passengers at\nthe various points, which will re-\nquire the the installation of a wide\nvariety of facilities.\nNo arrangement has at the pres-\nent time been concluded for land-\ning at Hongkong."
