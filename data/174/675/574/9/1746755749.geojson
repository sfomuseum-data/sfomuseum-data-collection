    "sfomuseum:description": "Interview conducted by Carol L. Osborne on September 27, 1997\r\rThis interview describes Captain Andersen’s experiences as First Officer / Copilot, Captain / Pilot, Assistant Chief Pilot, and Chief Pilot with Pan American World Airways from 1942 until 1981; his training and role as an instructor in the Civilian Pilot Training program (CPT), at the Tex Rankin School of Aeronautics, and with Pan American; and the work he performed.  He discusses the flights out of Seaplane Harbor at Treasure Island from 1944-1946, the move to San Francisco’s Coast Guard Station, then Mills Field (San Francisco Municipal Airport).  He describes the opening of the new terminal at San Francisco International in 1954 and the growth of the airport since then.  He discusses the aircraft he flew, including training on the Piper Cub, the Ryan ST, and the Fairchild M-62; and flying the Martin PBM, the Consolidated PB2Y-3, the Martin M 130 (China Clipper); the Boeing 314, 377 Stratocruiser, 707, and 747; and the Douglas DC-3, DC-4, and DC-7.\r\rHe describes the routes he flew, including the Pacific Division from San Francisco to Hawaii, Wake Island, Tokyo, Sydney, Auckland, and Fiji; and the Latin America Division from Miami to Rio de Janeiro and Rio to Buenos Aires and Belem.  He recalls his experiences flying soldiers back to the United States during the Korean Airlift from 1951 to 1953, and as a pilot on the first DC-4 polar flight from San Francisco to London in 1957.  He describes his role as a pilot-manager and some of the reorganizations he experienced; he also briefly discusses his thoughts about the mandatory retirement age.  He reminisces about other San Francisco-based Pan American employees, including Harold Gray, James (Jim) Fleming, Birgit Birkland, Sam Pryor, and Charles (Chuck) Gregg.",
