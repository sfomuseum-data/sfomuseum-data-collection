      "\"DITCHING\"\n• . . WHAT'S THAT?\nPilots in World War II affectionately nicknamed the\nEnglish Channel the \"Ditch,\" and sometimes had to\nmake forced landings in it. That's why an emergency\nlanding anywhere at sea in a land aircraft is known as\n\"Ditching:\"\nInteresting isn't it?\nNO WET FEET FOR YOU!\nRelaxed in your comfortable\nseat, you can be secure in the\nknowledge that your Rolls-Royce\npowered Jetprop has every\nscientific safeguard that could\npossibly be needed for any emer-\ngency. And you should be well\naware that Aloha Airlines' splen-\ndid record and carefully trained flight crews all add\nup to assurance that you'll land where your ticket\nsays you will land—without getting your feet wet!\nTHERE'S A PROPER PROCEDURE\nBut just as International Maritime Regulations re-\nquire passengers on the high seas to be instructed in\nlife-boat procedure, so you, too, should know about\nyour Jetprop's emergency equipment in the very\nunlikely event that you take part in a Ditching.\nTo make an unexpected sea landing safely and com-\nfortably there are a few simple things you must know\nhow to do, and when to do them. Let's proceed, then,\nto some pointers on Ditching Procedure ... so you\ncan take to the water as serenely as a sea gull.\nFIRST THINGS . • • FIRST\nEach member of your Alohaliner\ncrew has been carefully trained\nin emergency procedure.\nThe\ncrew members will assist you,\nbut you'll help, of course—by\nkeeping calm and following their\ninstructions.\nLife vests are fashionable in\nemergency landings.\nYours is quite handsomely tailored.\nYou'll find one\nin the zipper pocket on the back of each seat (pas-\nsengers in the front row of seats will find theirs in\na rack under the seat).\n\"PREPARE FOR DITCHING\"\nImagine that your Captain has\ndecided to prepare for a Ditch-\ning. He'll give the order \"Pre-\npare for Ditching.\" When you\nreceive the order, remove any\nsharp objects such as pencils\nfrom your coat, take off your\nglasses, loosen your collar, re-\nmove your tie, and if you're wearing high-heeled\nshoes, take them off. Don't take off any other clothes.\n(You'll want to look your best when you land\nand you'll be warmer in the life raft, too.)\nNow take your life vest out and slip it over your\nhead with the narrow straps at the back. Attach the\nmetal ring on the left narrow strap to the snap in\nfront, and the ring on the right strap to the other\nsnap.\nThe vest is very simple to inflate, but don't inflate it\nuntil\nyou are outside the ditched airplane.\nREADY? . . . GET SET!\nNext, adjust your seat as far for-\nward as it will go (in an upright\nposition) and fasten your seat\nbelt snugly around you. Just be-\nfore landing, lean forward as far\nas possible and rest your arms on\nyour knees.\nKEEP SEATED ... AND CALM\nYou'll next hear the order,\n\"Stand by for Ditching,\"\nYou're in your seat, of course, and when the plane\nmakes contact with the water you'll feel two bumps\n-the first slight, the second stronger. Until the plane\nhas completely stopped moving, stay in your seat.\nThen unfasten your seat belt. You'll be told when\nit's time to leave the plane and step into your life raft.\nTHAT FASHIONABLE VEST\nWhen you're out of the airplane\nyou can blow up your life vest.\nIt's very easy. Just pull the two\ncords at the bottom with a sharp\njerk downward,\nfirst one\nand\nthen the other. If the vest does\nnot inflate immediately, take the\nend of the rubber tube you'll"
