      "here's a reason why United flies more passengers, more\nplanes and more miles than any other line in the world\nU\nNITED\nflies\nmore passenger\nmiles than all the commercial\nair lines of England, France,\nGermany combined! Each 24 hours\nthe planes of this one\nline cover\n40,000 miles. Every United plane is a\nlarge twin-engined 3-mile-a-minute\nBoeing, completely equipped with\nthe most modern aids to flying.\nUnited's pilots average 4500 hours\nin the air — well over half a million\nmiles apiece. The stewardess, in ad-\ndition to being an attractive hostess,\nis a registered nurse. Mothers with\nbabies and small children, or elderly\npeople who find ordinary kinds of\ntravel strenuous are particularly ap-\npreciative of the stewardess service\non United planes.\nEvery plane is constantly in touch\nwith landing fields along the route\nby two-way radio telephone. There\nare\nnearly 1400\nUnited Air\nLine\nemployees.\nOn a single Coast-to-\nCoast flight scores of airplane and\nengine experts,\nradio dispatchers,\nweather observers, airway caretakers,\ninstrument specialists, technicians\nand\nother\nexperienced\npersonnel\ncheck and double-check the progress\nof the planes.\nToday thousands of people in all\nparts of the country are using this\npioneer air service as a better and\nmore modern way to travel. Business\nmen \"commute\"\nto cities three or\nfour hundred miles away. Vacation\nists use the air lines to save as much\nas four or five days out of a two-weeks'\nholiday.
