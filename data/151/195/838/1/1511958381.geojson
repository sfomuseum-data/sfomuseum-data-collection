      "International Tributes to the History of Flight\nThe Final Flight of the Hindenburg\nThe 804-foot LZ-129 Hindenburg was the world's larg-\nest and most luxurious passenger airship. Built in\nairship.\nThe full-color cachet pictures the Hindenburg\n1936, it was designed especially for trans-Atlantic\nfloating gracefully over New York, en route to its\ntravel.\nlanding berth at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Many histo-\nrians believe that a broken bracing wire slashed a gas\nOn its first ocean crossing of 1937, the Hindenburg\ncarried 36 passengers and 61 crew members. It was\nabout 7:20 p.m. on May 6, 1937 when the giant ship\napproached its berth at Lakehurst, New Jersey. To\nthe horror of spectators on the ground, there was\nsuddenly a bright glow near the tail, as the dirigible's\nhydrogen fuel burst into flames. Shriveled, bent and\ntorn, the Hindenburg plummeted to earth, killing 35\npeople. Public furor in the wake of the accident effec-\ntively wrote the end of the era of the commercial\ncell and caused the great ship to explode as it made\nits approach.\nMint Stamp: The mint stamp on this Cover,\nshowing\nthe Hindenburg in flight, was issued by Upper Volta\nin 1976. The huge ship traveled between Frankfurt,\nGermany and cities in North and South America.\nPostmark: This Cover was postmarked in Lakehurst,\nNew Jersey on May 6, 1984, the exact anniversary of\nthe disastrous accident involving the Hindenburg.\n© Postal Commemorative Society\nPrinted in U.S.A.\n2019.05601024"
