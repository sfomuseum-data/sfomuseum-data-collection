THIS\nCHANNEL, SHOWN by the MARKERS, IS 700 FT. WIDE and EXTENDS 1 MILE EASTWARD\nFROM THE TERMINAL BUILDING TO DEEPER WATERS Of BISCAYNE BAY.\nTHIS BASE IS CLOSER TO HAVANA (229 MILES) THAN TO DAYTONA. FLORIDA (257);\nCLOSER TO MEXICO (540 MILES DIRECT) THAN ATLANTA (627): NEARER SOUTH AMERICA\n(1090 MILES) THAN NEW YORK(1196). HOWEVER.
