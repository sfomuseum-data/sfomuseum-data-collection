IN VICTORY WE DESERVE IT, IN DEFEAT WE\nNEED IT\".\nIT WAS WINSTON CHURCHILL HIMSELF WHO REFERRED TO THE HOUSE OF POL ROGER\nAS \"THE WORLD'S MOST DRINKABLE ADDRESS\". A COMPLIMENT THAT WAS REPAID BY\nTHE HOUSE AFTER HIS DEATH IN 1965 WHEN THEY BORDERED THEIR LABELS IN BLACK\nIN REMEMBERANCE OF THE GREAT MAN.\nTHE WINE ITSELF IS A CLASSIC, PINOT NOIR DOMINATED BLEND OF EXTRAORDINARY\nDEFINI AND FAVOUK.

THE FIVE GRAND CRU VINEYARDS\nARE EACH TINY AND YET THEY MUST SATISFY A MARKET THAT IS INCREASINGLY\nTHIRSTY FOR THE PRODUCE. WE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE TO OFFER THIS 1991\nCHEVALIER-MONTRACHET FROM THE DOMANIES DU CHATEAU DE BEAUNE, ONE OF\nBURGUNDY'S OLDEST AND MOST PRESTIGIOUS HOUSES.\nTHE AROMAS ARE AN ALLURING BLEND OF RICH. RIPE FRUIT AND SUBTLE OAK; ON THE\nPALATE LAYERS OF FLAVOUR ASSAULT THE TASTE BUDS; HONEY AND BUTTERY RICHNESS\nAND, AGAIN, THAT SUBTLE OAKINESS THAT ROUNDS OFF THE FINISH. AS YOU\nWOULD EXPECT FROM A GRAND CRU, IT IS A WINE OF STUNNING\nCONCENTRATION.\nRED BURGUNDY\nHospices de Beaune\n1990\nCORTON\nSoled be BROADE CEMAR\nCORTON GRAND CRU, CUVÃ‰E DOCTEUR PESTE, 1990\nHOSPICES DE BEAUNE\nTHE BEAUTIFUL BURGUNDIAN WINES FROM THE 1990 VINTAGE ARE JUST NOW\nREACHING THEIR PEAK, YET SUCH WAS THE POWER OF THIS GREAT YEAR THAT THEY\nWILL HAPPILY REMAIN AT THAT PEAK FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.\nTHE ANNUAL AUCTION OF THE WINES OF THE HOSPICES DE BEAUNE, A CHARITABLE\nINSTITUTION, TAKES PLACE IN MID-NOVEMBER. WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BUY 10\nHOGSHEADS, JUST 250 CASES, OF WHAT WAS ARGUABLY THE BEST RED WINE\nAVAILABLE IN 1990 - A GRAND CRU BLENDED FROM FIVE VINEYARD SITES ON THE HILL\nCFCOKION. NAMED AFTEK INE BENEFACIOR WHO DONATED THE VINEYARDS.T\nHAS THE CHARACTERISTIC SOFT BERRY AROMAS OF PINOT NOIR BUT IT ALSO HAS A\nSPICINESS, A DEPTH OF FLAVOUR AND A ROUNDNESS NOT ALWAYS ASSOCIATED\nWITH THIS GRAPE\nPORT\nDOW'S\n1978\nRESERVE\nPORT\nDOWS 1978 RESERVE TAWNY PORT\nDOWS, ONE OF THE LEADING PORT HOUSES, WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1798 AND IS\nNOW RUN BY THE SYMINGTON FAMILY.
