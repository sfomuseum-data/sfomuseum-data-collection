We tested every wine in-flight to make sure it\ntastes just as good at altitude as on the ground. Enjoy!\"\nWHITES\nSebastiani Chardonnay, Sonoma, California, 2006\nThis wine is absolutely seductive, with full-blown exotic\nmango-pineapple fruit, creamy butterscotch oak, a snappy acidity\nthat gives it balance and lovely food affinity. Enjoy it with hard cheeses,\nrisotto, grilled fish and shellfish.\nFULL BODIED\nOcchio a Vento Vermentino, Tuscany, Italy, 2006\nAsin per are veto Veerin, us on white steper grape that is\nre-emerging in that region. The exotic flavors make it perfect to pair\nwith fennel salad, caramelized onion pizza, or sausage pasta.\nLIGHT BODIED\nREDS\nWente Vineyards Southern Hills Cabernet Sauvignon,\nLivermore, California, 2005\nThe Wente family's 100 years of California winemaking experience shows\nin every bottle they make.

The dense chocolate-dipped fig and spicy plum\npudding notes of this wine are perfect with blue cheese or chocolate.\nOr just by itself!\nFULL BODIED\nJurançon Prestige, Cave de Gan Jurançon, France, NV\nThis is honeyed pears and peaches in a glass, with soft floral,\nquince paste and candied apricot overtones. Delicious with cheeses,\nice cream, or just on its own.\nLIGHT BODIED\nSPARKLING WINE\nScharffenberger Brut Sparkling Wine, California, NV\nThe fragrance of white flowers and baking pastry compliments an\nappley-crisp flavor with notes of lychee and yellow plums.\nThe creamy texture and long finish make it a pleasure on its own,\nbut it is also delicious with salads, light fish dishes,\nsalty snacks and hard cheeses.\nLIGHT BODIED"
