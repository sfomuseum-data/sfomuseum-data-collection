      "A matter of taste:\nKLM's wine cellar in the sky\nWith wine, the truth is not on the label but\nbehind it - in the bottle. Only by sampling a\nwine, can its quality be judged. This is why\nKLM has it's own wine tasting panel - a dedicat-\ned group of experts who select the best possible\nwines for you, our passenger, throughout the\nyear. At the panel sessions, tastings are always\nblind. In this way, the participants are not influ-\nenced by name or reputation but only by the\nintrinsic qualities of the wine itself compared\nwith wines from the same country, region or\ngrape. The samples often come straight from\nthe producers themselves, so that KLM's wine\ncellar in the sky regularly carries exclusive wines\nno other airline can offer.\nLooking at our wine list, you will find wines\nfrom famous, classical regions as well as 'KLM's\nSpecial wine' which changes more frequently.\nBy offering you a choice of our classical stan-\ndard wines or our special wine, KLM affirms the\nindisputable truth that wine means variety.\nPlease judge for yourself - ask the cabin staff to\nlet you try the various wines and you will discov-\ner your favourite wine and food combinations,\nwhich are - of course - very much, a matter of\ntaste.\nHubrecht Duyker\nWine writer\nNon-alcoholic beverages\nAlcoholic beverages\nLight\nCoca-Cola\nRegular\n(oca'Cola\nCoca-Cola\nSprite\nLipton Ice Tea non-carbonated\nGinger ale\nSoda water\nTonic water\nSourcy carbonated mineral water\nVittel non-carbonated mineral water\nVittel\nFreshly squeezed orange juice\nFreshly squeezed apple juice\nTomato juice\nSkimmed milk\nColombian coffee\nColombian decaffeinated coffee\nTea, assorted flavours\nAperitifs\nCampari\nManzanilla la Goya\nSpirits\nChivas Regal 12 years old\nGlenlivet malt 12 years old\nJim Beam Kentucky streight Bourbon\nDutch gin (Jonge )enever)\nBacardi white rum\nAbsolut vodka\nBombay Sapphire\nCles des Ducs Armagnac VSOP\nCognac\nRémy Martin VSOP\nLiqueurs\nDrambuie\nCointreau\nBailey's\nBeer\nHeineken\nHeineken"
