These vineyards originally\nproduced still wines that competed with Burgundy, however, in the 17th\ncentury, the discoveries of a benedictine monk, Dom Perignon, led to a\nmethod of producing the sparkling wines known throughout the world\ntoday as champagne.

The wines from this area\nare produced from Pinot Noir\ngrapes and known for their fine\ndepth of colour, strength and\nagreeable bouquet. Gevrey-\nChambertin burgundy is a har-\nmonious blend of these wines\n- rich and yet delicate.\nSCANDINAVIAN AQUAVIT\nAALBORG AKVAVIT\nDanish aquavit - produced in\nAalborg since 1846.
