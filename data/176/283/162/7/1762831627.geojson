      "Rodgers - 3\nThese were not the only letters prepared for this flight. A\nlarger number had been aboard the other plane, the PN-9, No. 3. But\nSnody and his covers were forced down about 300 miles off the California\ncoast. Rodgers, too, had more than two covers.\nWhile in California preparing for the flight, Rodgers, who\nhad formerly commanded the Ford Island Air Station near Honolulu, met\na friend from the Islands,\nShe asked him to\ntake a few letters to her friends in Hawa11. Possibly this was suggested\nby Rodgers. These covers also flew - and sailed - with Rodgers although\nthe existence of these other letters on the Rodgers flight was never\nIncluded in the Navy's official report.
