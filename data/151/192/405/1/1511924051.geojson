      "EMERGENCY\nINSTRUCTIONS\nFOR YOUR SAFETY\nJUST IN CASE...\nPAN AMERICAN\nSuper-7 Clipper Service\nCLIFFER. TRADE MARK, FAN AMERICAN WORLD AIRWATS. INC",
      "omergency\nLandings\nPut your arms through the loops -\nthen place jacket over your head.\nAn emergency landing is most improbable when\nyou are flying in a Clipper because it is a multi-\nengine aircraft with ample reserve power to\nremain aloft under emergency conditions.\nJust the same, every precaution has been taken\nfor your safety should trouble arise.\nYour\nClipper crew has practiced many times what to\ndo in an emergency and your Clipper carries\nhundreds of pounds of safety equipment includ-\ning an emergency radio set capable of sending\nan SOS constantly hundreds of miles in all di-\nrections. Life rafts are stowed away in strategic\nlocations, each outfitted with food and water.\nIf an emergency should arise, your Clipper\nCaptain will first radio for assistance. Next, he\nwill inform you-\neven though the situation is\nfar from serious. We believe in keeping every\npassenger completely informed at all times.\nYour part is to cooperate and remain calm.\nLet's just make believe\nLet's make an imaginary emergency landing.\nFirst, make yourself as comfortable as pos-\nsible.\nRemove things which obviously could\nhurt you such as pencils, pens, sharp jewelry.\nMen, loosen your collars. Ladies, please take\noff those high-heeled shoes.\nYOUR LIFE JACKET\nNext, if it is a water landing, you will be in-\nstructed to put on a modern,\nlightweight life\njacket which you will find in a compartment\nunder your seat, or in a compartment indi-\ncated by your cabin attendant. To remove the\njacket from its plastic container, pull the tab\nacross the top of the bag.\nThen slip it on ac-\ncording to the directions shown in the next\npanel.\nThen you should immediately adjust the back\nof your seat to a forward, vertical position and\nfasten seat belt. A short time before the emer-\ngency landing you will be given the order\n\"Brace for landing.\" Clasp your hands under\nyour knees and bend forward with head on lap\nas nearly as possible. This, along with your\ncushioned seat, will relieve any sudden stop.\nWhen plane comes to a stop in its forward\nlanding motion, open your seat belt and follow\nthe next instructions of your crew to evacuate\nthe aircraft.\ngrasp straps under\nyour arms and pull\ndown sharply to snap breakaway\nthreads and release straps.\nPull straps down\nuntil back flap is fully\nextended, as shown\nat left and below.\nPull tab-end straps in an outward\nmotion until jacket is snug.\nTo inflate pull down sharply\non the two inflation knobs;\nMouth Inflation Tube:\nUsed only further inflations\npulled. To use, blow into mouthpiece.\nDO NOT INFLATE JACKET IN CABIN\nThe inflated jacket would hamper passing\nthrough the emergency exit.\nPull off handle cover.\nEMERGENCY\nEXITS\nTurn handle upward.\nPush window\nPull escape\nrope down\nYou have probably located the emergency exit\nnearest you-there is an \"Emergency Exit\"\nover the window. Seat backs opposite the emer-\ngency exits may be reclined fully, (some may also\nbe pushed forward and down flat against seat cush-\nions). Just below the window is a plastic cover over\na red nanore. run on the top or the plasue cover to\nremove. Turn handle upward and then push out on\naft end of window exit until it latches wide open.\nMembers of the Flight Crew will be in charge of\nthe life rafts. Your sea-going raft has adjustable\nsides and sun shade to protect you from the sun,\ncold, and water spray. If it is a land emergency\nlanding, then reach up, grasp tab at top center of\nexit window frame and pull escape rope down until\nit is fully extended outside the plane. Then passen-\ngers lower themselves to ground by the escape rope.\nEVACUATION\nSLIDE\nFor Land Landings\nAttach floor straps here.\nOpen door and kick out slide.\nSlide to ground.\nIf an emergency landing is made on land, the emer-\ngency slide will also be used to evacuate passengers.\nOrdinarily your crew will take care of the slide, but\nyou may be asked to assist. The emergenev slides\nare packed in neat pouches on the inside of the\nmain cabin door and on the right hand rear door\nexit, and attached as shown in the above photo. Un-\nsnap the entire front flap of the pouch; pull out the\nblue and vel low strap fittings and attach to similar\ncolored fittings on the floor.\nThen open the cabin\ndoor and kick out the slide. Two men, selected by\nthe crew, should then slip to the ground and hold\nthe extended end of the slide away from the plane.\nOther passengers will then jump into the slide in\nsitting position and slide to the ground.",
      "IN CASE OF ANY\nEMERGENCY LANDING\nREMEMBER THESE SAFETY RULES\nIN EMERGENCY EXIT.\nKnow the location of the emer-\ngency exit nearest you. There is\na sign that reads \"Emergency\nExit\"' above each one.\n2\nKnow the location of your life\njacket—it's underneath your\nseat, or in the compartment in-\ndicated by your flight attendant.\n3\nLoosen collar and tie. Remove\nglasses and sharp objects from\npockets. Put on life jacket, if\ninstructed, and fasten seat belt.\n4\nAdjust seat to vertical position.\nAssume proper posture to relieve\nstrain of possible sudden stop.\n5\nNever inflate your life jacket\ninside cabin. Wait until you\nget outside the plane.\nBe calm and cooperative until help comes.\nFollow the instructions of your aircraft officers.\nPRINTED IN U.S. A.\nF30-4040\n1-58-7C\n2002.127.411"
