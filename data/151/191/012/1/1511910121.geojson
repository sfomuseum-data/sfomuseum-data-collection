      "COPY\nWAR DEPARTIENT\nHEADQUARTIRS NINIH CORPS AREA\nOFFICE OF THE AIR OFFICER\nPresidio of San Francisco, Calif.\nOctober 6th, 1925.\nExcerpt from 1st Lieut.\nH. A. Moore's letter.\n\"In reply to your letter of September 15th to Golonel F. P. Lahn,\nat present away from the City on a short leave of absence,\nI am enclosing herewith\nthe sketch which you requested, together with some additional information on\nlanding field requirements and an estimate of\nAs the field stands to-day, the runvays - as I have placed them -\nare\nentirely too short to accommodate all\ntypes of planes.\nthis matter in the right vay, the thing to do is to\nIf you want to go into\nextend the runways on out\ninto the marshy ground - making them appriximately fifty yards wide and as\nfar\nNortheast and Southeast as possible, bearing in mind the high power lines and\nthe fact that an obstacle at the edge of a field outs off seven feet of runway\nfor each obstacle of its own height. Perhaps three or four handred feet could\nbe added in this way.\nAccording to the chart, the prevailing winds will permit\nof landing into the Northwest and Southwest.\nthe field is too small for a\nrunay from Last to West, I have placed the hangars, shops, etcetera, along\nthe\nWest edge of the field next to the highway.\nThe entire portion of hard ground\nmust be dragged and smoothed before being used.\nI would like to\nsuggest that if you care to laok into the future, when you\nneed a much larger airport, you might consider the proposition of having the\nP. G. \u0026 E. power lines removed and filling in\nthe marshland to\nthe Bast, thereby\nproviding a field with a one-half mile runway last and West. In such event the\nhangars\ncould be\nlocated on the North and South side of the field.\nYou would\nthen have a sufficient area for every type of plane, together with a high\ntelephone, telegraph, or power line around a field is a\npotential menaceto landing and taking off.\""
