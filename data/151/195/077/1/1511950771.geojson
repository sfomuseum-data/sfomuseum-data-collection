The\ngood things you feel come from\nthe pride our people have -\nin their jobs and in their airline.\nBut if you ever have the\noccasion to ship cargo on\nContinental, you'll find a differ-\nence you can actually see\n...on your watch. Air freight\nshipments can be accepted\nas late as 45 minutes before\nflight time and picked up\njust 45 minutes after landing.\nThis time savings is a result\nof the same Continental pride\nthat makes you feel so good\nas a passenger. So if you ever\nhave anything to do with air\nfreight, specify us and see the\ntime pride saves. And when\nyou go as a passenger,\ntravel with us and feel the\ndifference pride makes.\n126.013",
      "3+2=6?\nNo this isn't the \"new math\" - it's\njust a way of saying our Club Coach\nseating adds up to extra room for you.\nYou see we have 5-abreast seating\n(instead of the usual 6) in all our\njets. So when you travel \"coach\" on\nany Golden Jet flight — to any desti-\nnation, at any time - you can be sure\nyou get the additional roominess\nand comfort of 3-and-2 seating.\nWhat's more, on our big four-engine\nGolden Jets, Coach seats are as wide\nas First Class. Continental's Club\nCoach service - with its extra room,\ngood meals and cocktails - makes\ntraveling more fun for all jet coach\npassengers... including those traveling\non our economical family and excursion\nfare plans. It's a plus any way you\nfigure it.\nCONTINENTAL The Proud Bird with the Golden Tail"
