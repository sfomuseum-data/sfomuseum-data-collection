In the 19 years since Pan American pio-\nneered over-ocean transport, Flying Clippers have flown over\n6 million passengers more than half-a-billion overseas miles.\nThat's equivalent to more than 71,000 Pacific crossings. First\nairline to span this vast ocean (1935), Pan American today\nserves the entire Pacific Basin.\nPioneer in service, too. In establishing the world's longest com-\nmercial airlanes,\nPan American developed many important\ntrans-ocean services ... including long-range weather forecast-\ning, improved radio equipment, instrument flying and advanced\naerial navigation. Many other services have been introduced by\nPan American -from in-flight meals to steward service. And\nnow, the Sleeperette.\nTime-tested equipment. Big, 4-engine Clippers serve you in the\nPacific. Douglas DC-4s that took the greatest flight test in the\nhistory of aviation. Logging millions of miles under grueling\nwartime conditions, the Douglas DC-4 was rated perfect for\nperformance, safety and durability.\nBest-trained personnel. Your pilot? He's gone through the\nworld's most rigid training! He has averaged more than 1½\nmillion miles in the air. He's the world's most experienced\nover-ocean pilot. And he captains a seasoned multiple crew-\na vital safety factor.\nMighty handy at\nmealtime - this ad-\njustable table. There's\nno balancing of tray on\nlap. It adds to the enjoy-\nment of the delicious\nmeals and light snacks\nserved aloft ... and that\ngoes for beverages from\nthe bar, too.\nWORLD - WIDE SAFETY RECORD\nFor logging 43,878,591 flying miles\nwithout a single flight accident, Pan\nAmerican now holds the coveted\nAviation Safety Award for 1946.\nAfter meals you can lean back, stretch out your legs\nfor restful relaxation, and ride through the skies - at\npeace with the world.
