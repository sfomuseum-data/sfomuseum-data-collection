Herrmann; UAL Curtiss Falcon postcard signed by actor Michael Douglas; from donor notes: “Michael Douglas was in the TV series, ‘Streets of San Francisco’. He was on my flight from San Francisco to Portland. Another fellow was with him so we had plenty of time to talk. He told me all about the film he was directing, ‘One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest’ that they were filming in Salem, OR. He was a flirt but so very interesting. Won an Academy Award for the picture.”",
