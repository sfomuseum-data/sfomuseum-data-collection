      "Water landings\nA water landing is improbable while you are\nflying in a Clipper, because it remains aloft on\nany two of its four engines.\nJust the same, Pan American's Clippers are\ndesigned to withstand such landings. Airtight\nwing tanks and cabin keep the aircraft afloat\nlong after you board life rafts. Ditched planes\nhave remained afloat for over a day and a half.\nIf trouble should arise, your Clipper Captain\nwill first radio for help. Next, he will inform\nyou-even though the situation is far from\nserious. We believe in keeping every passenger\ncompletely informed at all times.\nYour safety instructions\nYour Clipper crew has practiced many times\nwhat to do in case of an emergency. Your part\nis to cooperate quickly and completely.\nThe hundreds of pounds of the latest safety\nequipment aboard your Clipper was tested be-\nfore you boarded the plane. Instead of one life-\nraft, there are four stowed away in a strategic\nlocation. Each is outfitted with adequate food\nand water. Even fishing tackle. There is also\na radio sending set which can send an SOS, con-\nstantly, 2,000 miles in any direction.\nLet's just\nmake believe\nLet's make an imaginary water landing. First,\nmake yourselves as comfortable as possible.\nRemove things which obviously could hurt\nyou-such as pencils, pens,\nsharp jewelry.\nMen, loosen your collars. Women, wriggle out\nof those high-heeled shoes.\nIn the back of the seat in front of you, or in\nthe compartment indicated by your flight\nattendant, is one of the latest lightweight life\njackets. Nylon, too. Slip it on according to\nthe following directions:\n1 Pull tab to open container-\nand remove life jacket.\n2 Place life jacket\nover head-put\nhands through loops.\n3 Pull tabs to tighten straps.\n4 Black knobs inflate\njacket-do not pull\ninside aircraft.\nThe life jacket\nMouth inflation tube:\nscrew in green collar-\npush in mouthpiece—\nblow to inflate.\nNote! Used only after\ninflation knobs are\npulled, it necessary\nto inflate more.\nBlack knobs inflate\njacket. Do not\npull inside aircraft.\nPull-laos\nMouth\ninflarion\ntube.\nFlap goes\nbehind back.\nstraps encircle waist.\nA short time before any emergency water land-\ning, your Clipper Captain will give the order:\nBrace for ditching. Adjust back of seat to for-\nward, vertical position, secure seat belt, extend\nlegs out straight, clasp your hands under your\nknees and bend forward with head on lap as\nnearly as possible. That, combined with the\ncushioned seat, will relieve any sharp stop.\nNo doubt you've wondered what a water land-\ning feels like. The aircraft's belly will hit the\nwater first and you'll feel a slight jar ... then\nthe nose and wing sections will hit with a\ngreater jolt of about the intensity a navy pilot\nfeels on routine carrier landings.\nWhen plane stops its forward motion, open your\nseat belt and follow the next instructions of\nyour crew members to evacuate the aircraft.\nAfter you are out of the aircraft pull the two\nsmall knobs at the base of your life jacket.\nThey will inflate your jacket.\nThe Captain,\nCo-pilot, Flight Engineer and\nPurser will be in charge of the four rafts. Your\nsea-going raft has adjustable sides and a sun\nshade to protect you from sunburn and water\nspray. During the late war some Army and\nNavy fliers ditched their aircraft as many as\nfive times, without injury. It almost got to be\na habit…really not so dangerous as you might\nthink, but Pan American wanted you to know."
