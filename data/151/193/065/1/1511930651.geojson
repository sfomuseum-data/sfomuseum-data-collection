      "A matter of taste:\nKLM'S wine cellar in the sky\nWith wine, the truth is not on the label but\nbehind it - in the bottle. Only by sampling a\nwine, can its quality be judged. This is why\nKLM has it's own wine tasting panel - a\ndedicated group of experts who select the best\npossible wines for you, our passenger,\nthroughout the year. At the panel sessions,\ntastings are always blind. In this way, the\nparticipants are not influenced by name or\nreputation but only by the intrinsic qualities of\nthe wine itself compared with wines from the\nsame country, region or grape. The samples\noften come straight from the producers\nthemselves, so that KLM's wine cellar in the sky\nregularly carries exclusive wines no other airline\ncan offer.\nLooking at our wine list, you will find wines\nfrom famous, classical regions as well as 'KLM's\nSpecial wine' which changes more frequently.\nBy offering you a choice of our classical\nstandard wines or our special wine, KLM\naffirms the indisputable truth that wine means\nvariety.\nPlease judge for yourself - ask the cabin staff to\nlet you try the various wines and you will\ndiscover your favourite wine and food\ncombinations, which are - of course - very\nmuch, a matter of taste.\nHubrecht Duyker\nWine writer\nNon-alcoholic beverages\nAlcoholic beverages\nLight\nPepsi Light\nRegular\nPepsi\n7 up\nLipton Ice Tea non-carbonated\nGinger ale\nSoda water\nTonic water\nSourcy carbonated mineral water\nNon-carbonated mineral water\nFreshly squeezed orange juice\nFreshly squeezed apple juice\nTomato juice\nSkimmed milk\nColombian coffee\nColombian decaffeinated coffee\nTea, assorted flavours\nAperitifs\nCampari\nTio Pepe fino sherry\nSpirits\nJohnny Walker Black Label\nGlenfiddich 12 year old pure malt\nJim Beam Kentucky bourbon\nDutch gin (Jonge Jenever)\nBacardi white rum\nAbsolut vodka\nDAMRAK\nDamrak Amsterdam Gin\nCles des Ducs Armagnac VSOP\nCognac\nRémy Martin Réserve exclusive\nLiqueurs\nDrambuie\nCointreau\nBailey's\nGrand Marnier\nBeer\nHeineken\nAmstel Light\nHeineken\nICe\nтей"
