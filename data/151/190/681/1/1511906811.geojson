      "U.S.A\nBY CLIPPER\nPAN AMERICAN\nWORLD'S MOST EXPERIENCED AIRLINE",
      "N\north east...south ...west-\nYou'll find the U.S.A. interesting-exciting-beautiful.\nNew York is generally considered the most vital and stimulat-\ning city on earth. There's an endless variety of things to see and\ndo ... smart shops, theaters, fine restaurants, the best in music\nand art-and, most inspiring of all, the United Nations. To view\nthe city from the top of a skyscraper is like having the world\nspread at your feet.\nNew England is the cradle of America and Boston is its princi-\npal city. There you will find quaint old streets, shops and his-\ntoric buildings. Some of America's most attractive scenery is\nin this vicinity.\nYour first impression of the Middle West will be one of space.\nChicago is the commercial hub of this vast area and Detroit its\nmost productive manufacturing center.\nIn the Pacific Northwest you will see nature at her most ex-\ntravagant .. mighty forests of redwood trees, towering water-\nfalls, snowcapped mountains. The principal cities of Seattle and\nPortland extend a friendly welcome to all visitors.\nOn the West coast you will find American living at its best\nwhere life in the outdoors sets the pace. The California coastline\nranges from rocky cliffs and a pounding surf to broad beaches\ngently touched by the blue Pacific. Both San Francisco and\nLos Angeles enjoy a mild climate year round.\nThe Southern states offer a great variety of climate and scen-\nery-from the lazy land along the Mississippi to the tropical\nsplendor of Florida with its sun-drenched beaches fringed with\ngraceful palms.\nThe whole United States is yours\nwhen you fly PAN AMERICAN."
