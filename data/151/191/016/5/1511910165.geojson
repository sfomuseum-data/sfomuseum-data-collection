The Commission refuses to\nestablish switching\nrates on a uniform basis between all points within a specified switching limit\nwithout regard to the length of the haul or the character of the territory\nthrough which the traffic moves.\nIt holds that there must be a limit to the\ndistance a rate of fixed volume\nwill carry, otherwise such switching limits\nwould be automatically extended with the expansion of industrial territory\nand the growth of cities.\nSWITCHING RATES-\nSwitching\npoints is often as expensive if not more\nso, than\nan equidistant line haul.\nRates for switching service should be graded out.\nThe Commission points out\nin the present proceeding that it is dealing entirely with the future rates to be\nassessed for local or intrayard switching.\nIn this application there is no rela-\ntion or connection with line haul traffic.\nApplicant authorized to cancel com-\nmodity freight rates applying between San Francisco and South San Francisco\nand Oakland switching limits. and establish zone rates in accordance with the\nschedule of charges included in the present proceeding.\nElmer Westlake, for Southern Pacific Company.\nSanborn \u0026 Rochl, for South San Francisco Chamber of Commerce.\nSeth Mann, for San Francisco Chamber of Commerce.\nWilliam J.
