      "2\n3\nA water landing is most improbable, of course, but you'll have\nplenty of warning if it is necessary. Both cabin signs will be\nturned on and a crew member will announce the emergency.\nHere's what you do:\nThe \"No Smoking\"\nsign will be on, so\nyou'll have to put out your cigarettes.\nIf you wear\nglasses or dentures, remove them and take out pens,\npencils and other sharp\nobjects from your pockets.\nWomen passengers should take off high-heeled shoes;\nthey're hard on the life raft.\nMen passengers should\nshed ties and loosen collars; it's a lot more comfort-\nable. No need to remove any other clothes.\nPut on your life vest. In Hawaiian's Con-\nvairs, you'll find the vest in the seat pocket in front\nof you.\nIn Hawaiian's DC-3s, you'll find it beneath\nyour seat.\nYou put it on as if it\nwere a sleeveless\njacket and tie the cords in front in bows. Don't inflate\nit while you're in the plane; it would just be cumber-\nsome for you.\n5\nYou'll be able to tell when the plane has\nstopped its forward motion.\nWhen it does, unfasten\nyour seat belt and stay in your seat until the\nCrew\nmember tells you it's time to board your life raft.\nThere are enough life rafts on all Hawai-\nian Airlines planes to accommodate everyone and a\ncrew member will be in each raft.\nWhen the officer\ntells you, step out of the plane and into the raft\nassigned to you.\nPULL TAGS\n\"D\" RINGS\nNow it's time to inflate\nYou'll see two cords with pull tags hanging from the\nlower edge of your vest.\nJust hold one cord in each\nhand and jerk\nYour vest will inflate\nThere's also an additional safety factor\n-two tubes through which you can inflate your vest\nlike blowing up a balloon.\nYou turn the\non each tube clockwise to open the tube, then counter-\nclockwise to seal it.\nNow just relax, sit back in your chair, bring\nthe back up to a vertical position and fasten your seat\nbelt as tightly as possible.\nYou'll be notified a short\ntime before the plane lands on water.\nWhen the cabin signs are\nflashed\nseveral\ntimes and then turned off, brace your hands and feet\nagainst the frame of the seat in\nfront of\nyou cannot reach the seat, rest your head\non your\nknees with your arms around your legs.\nYou'll prob-\nably feel two bumps; bracing yourself\nfor them will\nhelp relieve the impact.\n8\nBoth ships and search planes are on the\nway.\nThey were notified at the first sign of trouble\nand know where you are.\nMeanwhile you're safe and\nsecure on a big, roomy life raft and there's nothing\nmore for you to do\nbut follow instructions from\nyour crew."
