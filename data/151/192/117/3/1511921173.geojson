      "THE SATURDAY EVENING POST\nOctober 22, 1955\nChildren behave so well you hardly believe they're yours\nSHIP TRACES\nTravel with children becomes a pleasure\ninstead of a problem when you go by\nFlagship. That's because most Flagship\njourneys are over before children become\ntired, bored and cross the way they do\nfrom driving all day or from other\ntedious surface transportation.\nAmerican also helps to make family travel\nas easy on your budget as on your children.\nFor instance, you can use American's\nFamily ½ Fare plan on Mondays, Tuesdays,\nWednesdays and Thursdays when wives\nor children travel the Flagships with\nfather for half fare.\" Or you can fly\nAmerican's famous DC •6 Aircoach service\nat substantial savings. In addition, you can\napply American's \"Go Now-Pay Later\"\nPlan not only to all fares but also to\ncomplete packaged vacations.\nYou'll find the best behaved children are\nyours when you take them by Flagship.\nTake them soon and see.\nAMERICAN\nAIRLINES\nAmericas Leading Airline"
