In the past,\nthis has resulted in a high score of com-\npleted schedules. For TWA's route-\nchosen by Colonel Lindbergh in 1927-is\nnature-made for year-round flying.\nHowever, no airline is entirely free from\ntemporary weather interruptions. So this\nwinter, with government approval, TWA\noffers \"Selected Route Flying.\" This\nmeans TWA has a choice of several routes\nthat may be used as \"weather detours.\"\nWhat This Means To You\nAll weather is caused by \"pressure areas.\"\nThey are always on the move at about 30\nmiles an hour in a general eastward direc-\ntion. This means,\nfortunately, that all\nweather is both local and temporary.\nWith many routes to choose from, it's\neasy for TWA to avoid weather delays-\nto fly you around the weather rather than\nthrough it.\nNo one knows these facts better than\nTWA's flying management. Pilots them-\nselves, they saw in \"Selected Route Fly-\ning\" another opportunity to make flying\nmore comfortable and dependable for you.\nThis winter, take advantage of \"Select-\ned Route Flying\" on The Airline Run by\nFlyers. You'll agree it's air travel at its best!\nNext trip, phone your travel agent or TWA.\nTRANSCONTINENTAL\nThe Airline\n(TWA\n\u0026 WESTERN AIR, INC.\nRun by Flyers\n20\nAS"
