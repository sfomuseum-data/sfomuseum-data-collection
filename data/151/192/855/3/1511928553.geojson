I was therefore pleased\nwhen United Airlines asked me to\npresent its passengers with menus that\nreflect my ideas of healthy and\nsatisfying meals.\nThroughout my career, I have been\nfortunate to work on several culinary\ntelevision series, pen numerous\ncookbooks and serve as personal chef\nto some of the world's most influential\npersonalities-including Charles de\nGaulle. I have discovered that out of\nsimplicity-using fresh ingredients,\nsubtle dressings and classic sauces-\ncome the best and most pleasing\ndishes. A few thoughtfully chosen\nflavors can combine to create a\ndistinctive and enjoyable repast.\nWe have worked to develop a selection\nthat will bring you the satisfaction of\nprofessional culinary artistry and the\ncontentment of a home-cooked meal.\nUnited Airlines and I are delighted to\noffer you today's menu, and hope you\nwill take this opportunity to sit back\nand enjoy some of the finer things in\nlife-good food, good conversation and\na great flight with United Airlines.\njacques\nJacques Pépin\nMaster Chef\n012M101\nTO BEGIN\nGarden fresh salad\nAccompanied by country French or classic Caesar dressing\nMAIN COURSE\nUnited is proud to present the following special holiday selection,\ncreated especially for you by Master Chef Jacques Pépin.\nOven-roasted holiday turkey breast\nComplemented by a natural jus\nand served with bulghur apple stuffing\nand butternut squash gratiné\nSteak au poivre with a creamy brandy peppercorn sauce\nPresented with garlic mashed potatoes\nand sautéed bok choy and bell peppers\nDESSERT\nEli's Sunrise cheesecake\nSTARBUCKS coffee will be available throughout the flight.\nCrystal Geyser Natural Alpine Spring Water\nWe apologize if occasionally your choice is not available.\nTANS CON B"
