      "Rodgers - 4\ncover 1s addressed to Mies Helen Kisenan In Honolulu; \"Havali\" or \"T.H.\"\nwas omitted since Rodgera was place it in the mail in Honolulu as he did\nthe other two. This 10st cover also carries a manuscript notes \"Via /\nTranspific (alc) flight Favor of / Consander John Rodgers / August 31 - 25\"\nAnd of equal Interest, this cover still contains an enclosure, in the sane\nhandwriting as the address and manuscript cover note, that reads:\nHello Helen and you all.\nIsn't this fine to get a letter\nby air fron San Francisco to Honolulu. Consander Rodgere\nas kimenoure to take fen rove to able Aunt Kate\nmoronstrosen vaRs ung girl at that time and had an interest in otampo.\nThis was not the only letter sent by\nJohn Rodgers, to Hawall. The reciplent of the 11lustrated lost cover\nreports that another vent to her cousin and that three others vere gent\nto people then prominent in Honolulu - a former governor, the manager of\nWalkik1'a then leading hotel, and a social leader of the Islands. The\nwhereabouts of these other lost covers 1a not known undoubtedly some 1f\nnot all have been truly lost. But Comnander John Rodgere probably carried\nat least seven covers on his 1925 flight from California to Hava11.\nThese lost covers do differ in one way from the two recognized\nin the AAMC these lost five were delivered through the U.S.Mall in\nHonolulu rather than being hand-delivered by Rodgers.\nIntornation or conments about the lost John Rodgers covers would\nbe appreciated."
