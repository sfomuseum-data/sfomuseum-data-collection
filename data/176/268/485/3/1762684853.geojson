      "AIR MAIL\nYou should see the new Mas taf. It really is lovely. The decor is superb and\nthey have such brautiful scars. Especially in First Class, where they call\nthem Easy sleepers. The cloth is brush ralvet, and when you lean the seat\nright back, it sort of fits the contours of your body - riqht down to the footrest - so you\n*torqnt up to the upper deck, come those to ones in aer tes which are ages\nup to the ubber deck, unlike those spiral ones in other IHTs which are awkward\nto climb.\nThere's a Business Class too, just behind the First Class, and frankly it seems\nalmost as good as first. The seals are big — two abreast on cach side by the windows,\nand only four abreast in the middle. And you qet lots of First Class things such as free\ndrinks, movies, and sober elemonie head phones' - not those awkward lifle earplugs. The\nfood is fine, and they give you a choice\nthey're divided it into\nhaid onto int pars to ran a ma phan o an or to me,\nrestrooms), plus its own sewards and stewardesses. So, you find that your meals are\nsesued quickly, they're hot, and things come in the right order, id you get your\ncoffee not after the meal, not before it! They told me that the whole plane has as\nmany as eleven galleys.\nLastly, it really is a quiet plane. The angines are Rolls Royce, and you\nalmost don't notice them, wherever you're siling.\nMAS B747\n20151166.\nmas"
