      "AIR MAIL\nYou should see the new Mas #*7. It really is lovely. The decor is superb and\nthey have such beautiful seals. Especially in first Class, where they call\nthen 'Easy Sleepers! The cloth is brush ralret, and when you lean the seat\nright back, it sort of fils the contours of your body -right down to the footrest - so you\nactually can get a good skep. come to think ofit, even the stairease is bates It goes\ni up to the upper deck, unlike those spiral ones in other tHTs which are awkward\nto climb\nThere's a Business Class too, just behind the first Class, and frankly it secus\nalmost as good as first. The seals are big - two abreast on each side by the windows,\nand only four abreast in the widdle. And you get lols of First class things such as free\ndrinks, movies, and brober eletronie head phones - not those awkward little earplugs. The\nfood is fine, and they give you a choice.\nEvan in Economy, Was seems to gire you more than you'd expect. for crample,\nthey're divided it into three parts. Each part has a galley of its own (and its own\nrestrooms), plus its own stewards and stawardesses. so, you find that your meals are\nsaved quickly, they re hot, and things come in the right order, is you gat your\ncoffee hot after the meal, not before it! They jold me that the whole blank has as\nmany as eleven galleys\nrastly, it really is a quiet plane. he engines are Rolls Royce, and you\nalmost don't notice then, whererer you're silling\nMAS B747\n2015166.2539\nmas"
