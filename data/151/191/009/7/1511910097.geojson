      "Wind velocity, gustiness and turbulence.\nConsidering the entire period of observation, the greatest\naverage wind velocity occurred at Site No. 2, with Site No. 5,\nSites Nos. 1, 4 and 6 and Site No. 3 following in order.\nThe\nprovalling winds blew with greater average volooity at both\nSite No. 3 and Site No. 5 than at Sites Nos. 1, 4 and 6, but ex-\ntreme velocities of 30, 35 and 40 miles per hour or more were\nrecorded a greater number of times at Sites Nos. 1, 4 and 6 than\nat Site No. 5. Everything considered, Site No. 5 1s as windy as\nSites Ilos. 1, 4 and 6 and Site No. 2 1s even more so.\nThe least\naverage wind volocity and the greatest freedon from high winds\nwere found at Site No. 3.\nAlthough the lightest average winds and greatest freedom\nfrom high wind velocities were found at Site No. 3, the winds\nthere were very gusty, decidedly more so than at any of the other\nsuggested sites.\nGustiness was greater at Site No. 2 then at any\nof the others with the exception of Site No. 3 and there was little\ndifference botween Sites Nos. 1, 4 and 6 and Site No. 5, the latter\nhaving a slight advantage.\nInvestigation of turbulence in the first 1000 feet above the\nground revealed practloally identical conditions at Site No, 3\nand Site No. 6, and less favorablo conditions over the other\nproposed locations.\nProcipitation and Temperature.\nPrecipitation, the no remaining meteorological element\nfor which comparative data were obtained, did not very between\n-1-",
      "the several proposed sits by any considerable amount.\nNeither\nthe precipitation data in Table 19 nor the temperaturo data in\nTable 20 have any important bearing on airport location within\nthe aroa under consideration but they will be found to have\nother practical applications.\nConditions Summarized.\nFrom the consideration of data that have been presented,\n1t 1s obvious that Site No. 6 (Ills Fleld)* has an advantage\nover all other proposed sites in freedon from fog, visability, ceil-\ning, and constoney of wind direction. Moreover, the prevailing\nwind direction at Site No. 6 (Ills Meld*) 1s such that the majority\nof take-offs may be made over favorable territory, which cennot be\nsald for any other proposed site, excepting No. 4 (adjoining and to\nthe south of mills Floid*). In fact, dopartures may be made in any\ndirection from Site No. 6 (1411s Flela*) with favorable conditions\nfor an emergenoy landing in the proximity of the airport should\noccasion require 1t.\nIt was also found that the variation in wind direction from\nmoment to moment at site No. 6 (Mills Pleld*) was less than at any\nother proposed site except No. 2 (South San Francisco*).\nThe surface\nwind velocity at Site No. 6 (Ills Fold) was found to be more\n(South S.F.*)\nadvantageous for the operation of aircraft then at Site No. 2/and\nequally with Site No. 5 (Pt. San Mateo*), although smaller average\nwind velocities and greater freedom from high winds occured at\nSite No. 3 (Berestord*). The latter site, however, has a distinet\ndisadvantage on acoount of exoossive gustiness, en ovil from\nwhich a\u0026 site No. 6 (Alls Pleld) 1s relatively free. No other pro-\nposed site had less turbulence in the lower levels of the er than\nSito No. 6 (31118 Pleld)* while, above 1000 feet, smother air was\nNOTE: *words in perenthesis do not ocour in text.",
