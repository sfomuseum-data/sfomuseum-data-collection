      "International Tributes to the History of Flight\nFirst International Air Meet\nThe sport of flying came of age on August 22, 1909,\nwhen a giant air meet was staged in France. For the\nfirst time, the finest pilots and planes from Europe\nand America were assembled in one place to compete.\nThe \"La Grande Semaine d'Aviation de la Cham-\npagne\" was held on the plains of Bethany, three miles\nnorth of Reims. Leaders from many nations and a\nhalf-million spectators watched about 30 planes com-\npete in races, altitude, and long-distance contests.\nAmerica's Glenn Curtiss won the coveted speed race\nin an aircraft of his own design. The prize for altitude\n(508.5 feet) went to Frenchman Hubert Latham, while\nanother Frenchman, Henri Farman, won the distance\nprize (112 miles).\nThe full-color cachet shows the poster advertising\nthe aviation meet and the 200,000-franc Grand Prix\nevent which Curtiss won with speeds of 47.65 miles\nper hour for the two laps. Most of the financing for\nthe week-long meet came from local champagne\nvintners.\nMint Stamp: The mint stamp on this Cover was issued\nby the United States in 1980. It pictures Glenn Cur-\ntiss, America's official entry at Reims, and a plane\nsimilar to the one he flew in the competitions.\nPostmark: This Cover was postmarked in Reims, France\non August 22, 1985, the 75th anniversary of the begin-\nning of the first international air meet.\n© Postal Commemorative Society\nPrinted in U.S.A.\nW015. 056.014"
