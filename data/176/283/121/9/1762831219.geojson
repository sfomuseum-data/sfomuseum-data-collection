      "Oysters President Special.\nBack in the days of fifteen course meals, Diamond Jim Brady\nachieved legendary fame as this nation's champion bonvivant\nand thought nothing of consuming eight to twelve dozen\ngiant oysters as a mere prelude to meals.\nCreole Jambalaya.\nThe original recipe was introduced to the South during the\n1700's by the Spanish, and consisted mainly of ham. The\nCreole cooks, with their usual flair, added Gulf Shrimp and\nother spices and herbs.\nSourdough Rolls.\nPossibly the oldest of bread recipes dating as far back as 4000\nB.C. It is made with a sourdough \"starter,\n\" a self perpetuat-\ning yeast mixture made with a combination of flour, sugar\nand water. This bread became identified in America through\nits use by the Alaskan Sourdoughs, prospectors who carried\nsourdough starters strapped to their packs so that they could\nmake bread anytime they wanted without having to walk to\nthe nearest town, usually miles away.\nWaldorf Salad.\nThe original recipe was created by one of the most famous\nof Maîtres d'Hôtel, Oscar of the Waldorf.\nSalt Water Taffy.\nThis candy, almost a tradition is sold along the boardwalk\nat Atlantic City. Rumor has it that it is made with sea water.\nCover.\nOne of a series of photographs depicting Early 19th Century\ncooking utensils from New England, in wood, tin, ceramic,\ncast and handwrought iron.",
