      "Regional Wines\nGuenoc\nGuenoc, 1993, North Coast Chardonnay\nThe Guenoc label carries a portrait of the actress\nLillie Langtry who owned the estate and made wines\nthere during the last century. These days the wines are\namong the most modern in California, combining top\nquality fruit with the latest in winemaking expertise.\nThe result is this archetypal Chardonnay which\nmanages to integrate crisp fruit flavours with\nbuttery, apple nuances and the added texture\nand depth of new oak maturation.\nHAHN\nHahn Estates, 1990, Cabernet Sauvignon\nThis outstanding Cabernet Sauvignon is made from\nfruit sourced from the beautiful Santa Lucia highlands\nin the Monterey district to the south of San Francisco.\nThe 1990 vintage is considered to be the greatest\nrecent red wine vintage giving concentrated, rich wines\nwhich are surprisingly approachable now. This wine\nexhibits spicy, tobacco aromas together with\nconcentrated plummy fruit, a wonderful\nmatch for all meat dishes and cheeses.\nRA ORZA DALY CWOR\n10 16JU1.95 221C002-B95\nEuropean White Wines\nToday's flight will feature one of the following\nEuropean white wines for your enjoyment.\nLOUIS MAX\nbontagny\nMontagny, 1993, Louis Max\nThe appellation of Montagny is situated at the\nsouthern extreme of the Côte Chalonnaise in Burgundy\nand is an excellent source of high quality Chardonnay\nbased wines. This example from Louis Max is a perfect\nairline wine. It has sufficient weight of ripe fruit to\ncope with the effects of the pressurized cabin on the\npalate. The wine has concentrated citrus and honey oak\naromas as well as an attractive, rich, citrus fruit flavour\nwith an oak complexity and a fine texture.\nPOUILLY-FUISSÉ\nPouilly-Fuissé, 1993, Louis de Saint Bonnet\nPouilly-Fuissé is the best known commune of the\nMâconnais region in the south of Burgundy. It should\nnot be confused with the wines of Pouilly-Fumé,\na similar sounding village situated in the central\nvineyards of the Loire, making fine Sauvignon Blanc.\nPouilly-Fuissé is made from 100% Chardonnay grapes.\nIts fine balance between fruit and acidity is the result\nof a combination of limestone soil and sunny slopes.\nThis wine is particularly delicious with seafood.\nBA USLA DAILY CW OL\n16JUL.95 221C002-B95 1",
