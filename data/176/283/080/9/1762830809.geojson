      "531.9\nСору\nMr. Fred Shutts.\nDear Sir:\nWhen I was sent to the Mills Field (S.F.Air Port)\nMarch 28, 1927 to take charge of the grading and filling\nof the field.\nI found that\nthe\nemployees of the Mills\nEstate were\nhauling off the field some of the hay which had already\nbeen cut.\nThe employees of the Mills Estate who were hauling\nthe hay, gave\nme to understand that all the hay on the\nfield was to be used as cattle feed, so it was my policy\nthere after to notify these employees in which part of\nthe field we were going to fill or grade and they im-\nmediately cut the hay and hauled it away.\nYours truly,\n(Signed) Harry J. Law."
