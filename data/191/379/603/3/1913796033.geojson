      "Tokyo\nJuly 24th 1947\nDear Debby•\nHow grand it was to see and talk with Harold\nyesterday when he came out to lunch with us. He and the\nGeneral had met before in the General's office but we\ndid have a good talk just the three of us and I enjoyed\nso hearing about each of you. Harold also saw Arthur too\nfor a few minutes, Arthur broke his left arm the last of\nMay ice skating, the cast comes off today so you know how\npleased we are\nand grateful that the arm has healed so\nnicely).\nso much real pleasure and use from your sift as it ist\nThanks so for this lovely white sweater\nthe weight that I like and the fit,is perfect.\nWhat a wonderful family you have and what the grand\nchildren must mean to you and Harold(what very luchy\ngrandchildren they are I think with such grand parents)\nLife is busy here but really full of much interest\nand one of the most delightful things for me always are\nthe people we have out for lunch. The Trippe party, I\ndid enjoy, some I knew before.\nHarold looks so well and changed so very little all\nthese years, He and I talked some of course of\"S11m\"\nand\nMrs. Lindbergh(his mother) and I will write her a note\nas she will be interested in hearing that I have seen\nand talked with Harold. She evidently is not any too\nwell from what Harold told me and too I gathered that\nwhen I saw Slim in Australia.\nI keep up with Manila some from a few of the old ones\nwho are back but it is still a distressing picture,with\nso much destruction. Not the lovely Manila we knew\nand\nloved. Living is sky high there now too.\nThanks so for the lovely note you sent with the\nsweater,you can well understand I know what it means to\nme to hear such things said of the General.\nLove always to you and yours eau",
