      "International Tributes to the History of Flight\n= Henri Farman Breaks the One-Minute Barrier =\nA former artist and racecar driver, Henri Farman pur-\nchased his first powered aircraft, a Voisin biplane, in\nthe early 1900's. Then he set about to make major\nalterations to it, thus developing the aircraft that be-\ncame known as the Voisin-Farman I.\nAfter a series of successful tests, Farman took off\nin his biplane from Issy-les-Moulineaux, outside of\nParis, on November 9, 1907. As the amazed onlookers\ncheered and waved, the plane completed a circuit of\n3,380 feet. Even more important, it stayed in the air\nfor a full 74 seconds — 15 seconds longer than the\nprevious duration record set by the Wright brothers\nin 1903. The one-minute barrier was broken at last.\nThe full-color cachet pictures the Voisin-Farman I\nin flight. Among the extensive modifications Farman\nmade to the plane before his milestone flight were\nthe removal of the vertical panels between the wings\nand the improvement of the tail surfaces and land-\ning gear.\nMint Stamp: The mint stamp on this Cover was issued\nby Rwanda in 1978. It shows Henri Farman and his\nVoisin-Farman I in which he achieved another mile-\nstone in 1908 - the first officially logged flight of\nmore than one kilometer.\nPostmark: This Cover was postmarked in Paris, France\non November 9, 1985, the exact anniversary of the\nfirst European flight of more than one minute.\n© Postal Commemorative Society\nPrinted in U.S.A.\n2015.056.012"
