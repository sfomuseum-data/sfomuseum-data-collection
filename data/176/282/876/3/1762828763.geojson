      "Aloha\nfrom\nHawaii\nthe\nDiamond Head\nBeachcombers\nAfter Mark Twain visited the Hawaiian Islands, he described the grass shacks, the horse and\nsailboat travel, and the girls who would toss off their muu muus and jump into the water naked —\nalthough, Iwain insists, he wasn't really looking. The American humorists sense of stateside\npropriety may have kept him from looking, but it could also have been that he was kept busy\nlistening to the haunting and exotic music of the Islands.\nIn the days since Mark Twain's visit the grass shacks have been replaced by modern houses,\nhotels and motels; the horses by U-Drive cars; and the girls have become a bit more modest.\nThe music. however. remains as magical as it ever was, creating pictures of exotic flowers,\nThe Diamond Head Beachcombers are Island troubadours who use Hawaiian guitars and strings\nto portray Polynesian charm and develop a mood befitting tropic island romance. Working with\nsuch popular and attractive melodies as To 1ou, sweetheart, Alond, song of the Islands, A Dong\nof Old Hawaii and Lovely Hula Hands, the Beachcombers offer a musical tour of our newest\nstate that's complete and enchanting.\nMIKE Gross\nRecorded in New York City, April 1, 2 and 3, 1959.
