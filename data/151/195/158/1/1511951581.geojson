      "THE SATURDAY EVENING POST\nJuly 13, 1946\nThe luxurious lower-deck lounge of the Boeing Stratocru\nSmoothest ride in the world\nAboard a Boeing Stratocruiser you'll experience\na new kind of\nride — incomparably smoother\nthan you've ever known in surface transportation\nof any kind - or in any other airplane.\nYou'll relax and rest completely - go down-\nstairs to the sumptuously appointed lounge—\nwrite letters or read—and all the while you'll feel\nscarcely more motion than in your easy chair\nat home.\nThere are good reasons for this amazingly\nsmooth ride.\nThe size of the airplane - the\nunique Boeing wing and other features of\naerodynamic design — the over-weather altitudes\nat which it can fly - and its speed of more than 5\nmiles per minute — all contribute to level, velvet-\nsmooth flight. Even air bumps that would be\nsevere in other transports are reduced to a mini-\nmum dy the stratochiser.\nThe same Boeing engineering leadership that\nproduced the sturdy B-17 Flying Fortress and\nthe great B-29 Superfortress builds both stamina\nand easy riding qualities into the Stratocruiser.\nBoeing Airplane Company, Seattle, Washington;\nwichita. Kansas.\nBOEING\nThe Stratocruiser's uneaualled speed. comfort and reliability will soon be available on these forward-\nlooking airlines-Pan American World Airways, Swedish Intercontinental Airlines, Northwest Airlines,\nAmerican Overseas Airlines -for which Boeing is building fleets of these super-‡ransports\n+ YA 1897"
