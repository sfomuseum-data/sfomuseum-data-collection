      "THE SATURDAY EVENING POST\nAugust 17, 1940\nFLIGHT INFORMATIO\nService in the air and on the ground\nHE FLAGSHIP has tripled the speed of travel. It has increased the\n• convenience of travel. But it has done something more. It has cre-\nated in travel a new kind of personalized service.\nFirst evidence that you're a welcome guest comes when you phone\nfor a reservation. There's somebody at the other end of the wire who\ncares. When you arrive at the ticket office, you find that you're expected.\nRight there you're relieved of baggage and you don't see it again until\nit's delivered to you promptly at your destination.\nFrom the moment you step into a luxurious limousine in one city\nuntil you step out of one in another, you feel you're among friends.\nAttendants, porters, stewardesses and Flying Officers go out of their\nway to make you feel at ease and at home.\nThousands comment upon how infinitely simple and pleasant it is\nto make a trip by air. The comfort of air travel comes principally from\nthe smooth flight and luxurious appointments of the modern passenger\nplane. But it's the Flagship's personalized service which, as much as\nanything else, makes you want to fly again!\nMake your next trip by American Airlines which serves the princi-\npal cities of the nation, coast to coast. For reservations, or information\ncall your Travel Agent or the nearest American Airlines office.\nAMERICAN AIRLINES INC\nSYSTEM MAP\nAMERICAN AIRLINES 1c.\nROUTE OF THE FLAGSHIPS"
