      "AROUND THE WORLD\nVIA GUAM\n176-1976\nOn June, 1946, a crowd of 5,000 bid farewell to\nthe Pan\nAmerican World Airways \"Clipper\nAmerica\"\nas it set out from New York on the\nfirst regularly scheduled around-the-world com-\nmercial plane flight. Fitted out with forty-four\nfully reclining seats as well as pullman-type fold-\ndown berths, the new Lockheed Constellation rose\nto 20,000 feet to reach its cruising speed of 325\nmiles an hour and speed towards its first stop at\nGander, Newfoundland.\nThe crew of 10 and their 19 VIP passengers\n(including PAN AM president Juan T. Trippe)\nflew on to visit Shannon, London, Istanbul,\nDharan, Karachi, Calcutta, Bangkok, Manila,\nShanghai and Tokyo before arriving at Guam.\nWhile they had expected to be on Guam only long\nenough for a leisurely breakfast,\nthe plane\ndeveloped engine trouble soon after taking off\nand had to return to the island for minor repairs.\nTaking\nadvantage of the brief delay, the\npassengers were treated to a tour of the island by\nAdmiral Pownall,\nthe military governor of\nGuam. In addition to the scenic beauty of the\nisland, the sights that impressed them most were\nthe evidence of the frightful waste of the recent\nwar: hundreds of white crosses marched rank by\nrank to the edge of the jungle in a military\ncemetery and everywhere quonset huts and even\nfields were filled with now surplus war supplies\nof every description.",
      "Their plane was soon ready for takeoff once\nagain and they reached Wake Island in time for\ndinner that evening. The rest of their trip was\nuneventful as they flew on to Midway, Honolulu,\nSan Francisco and Chicago before arriving at\nNew York. In a little over 13 days (101 hours 32\nminutes of actual flight time) they had visited 10\ndifferent countries in completing their\nepic\n22,297 mile journey that ushered in a new era for\ncommercial aviation.\n2000:058.1257₽"
