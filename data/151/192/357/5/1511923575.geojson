For millions, it is the customary and routine way of getting from\none place to another. Once again, the last fiscal year set a new record for\npassengers using the San Francisco Airport, with 1,708,040 people passing\nthrough. This is a 30.6 per cent increase over the 1,307,307 comparable\nfigure for the previous fiscal year.\nAirline trips (arrivals and departures) jumped to 90,794 for the year,\na 13.8 per cent increase over the 79,777 trips for the previous year. With\nsuch large aircraft in use today, the number of trips need not increase\nso much in order to handle a greatly increased number of passengers.\nAir mail handled at the held jumped by 58.3\nper cent, primarily\nbecause of the Korean War. This year the total was 23,636,209 pounds, as\ncompared to 14,929,703 the previous year. Air Express was up from\n7,023,402 pounds to 8,342,420 pounds.\nAir Freight, a business which has developed amazingly since the end\nof World War II, climbed up to 35,503,778 pounds for the year. This\nfreight is made up of all kinds of goods from flowers to clothing.\nSan Francisco Airport, because of its tremendous growth recently, now\nvaries between fourth or fifth in the nation in passengers handled. New\nYork, Chicago and Washington, D. C. handle the most traffic.\n26",
