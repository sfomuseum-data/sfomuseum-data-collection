      "PAN AMERICAN\nFLIES TO GUAM\nPan American Airways was organized in 1927\nto contract for delivery of the U.S. mail from Flori-\nda to Cuba. The operation expanded rapidly through\nout the Carribean and soon their sights were set on\nthe vast expanse of the Pacific. In 1931 the Lind-\nberghs surveyed a proposed \"Great Circle' route to\nthe Orient via Alaska, Japan and China and Pan Am-\nerican contracted with both the Martin and Sikorsky\naircraft companies to design and build aircraft suit-\nable for long-distance, high-speed, over-water flights.\nBy the time the first plane was ready to fly in\n1935, Japanese hostilities in China necessitated on isl-\nand-hopping route to the Orient through the mid-\nPacific so on March 27, 1935 the steamer S.S.\nNORTH HAVEN set sail from Pan Am's San Fran-\ncisco Bay base of operations at Alameda to establish\nseaplane bases at Hawaii, Midway, Wake, Guam and\nManila.\nSikorsky was the first company to fulfill their\ncontract for Pan Am's new breed of airplanes and on\nApril 16, 1935 the PAN AMERICAN CLIPPER\nlifted off the waters of San Francisco Bay for a sur-\nvey flight to Honolulu and return. A second flight\nin June reached Midway and in August the third\nflight pushed on to Wake. On October 5 the fourth\nsurvey flight left Alameda and eight days later, after\na total flight time of 46 hours and 39 minutes, the\nfirst plane to fly to Guam set down on the waters of\nApra Harbor and taxied to Pan Am's newly complet-\ned base at the sea-side village of Sumay.\nOn November 22 the Martin company's stream-\nlined aircraft christened the CHINA CLIPPER was\nready for its assault on the vast Pacific. Amidst much\nfanfare, it took off from San Francisco Bay with a\ncargo of 1,837 pounds of mail and on November 27\nit reached Guam. After a layover of 39 hours, it took\noff for Manila, completing the first trans-Pacific mail\nflight at 3:32 p.m. on November 29, 1935."
