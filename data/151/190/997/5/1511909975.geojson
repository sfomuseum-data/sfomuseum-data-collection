      "UnITED Air Lines News\nNotebook for Company Personnel\nA Book of Facts and Figures About Your Company\n1935 Edition",
      "DO YOU KNOW . . .\n-that an air line is the shortest distance between two\npoints, and that an air line is the fastest way to get from\none to the other? Sure you do.\nBUT - there may be some interesting facts and\nfigures about the air transport business in general, and\nUNITEd Air Lines in particular, that you don't know.\n\"wish,\" one of our mechanics said one day, \"that the\ncompany would send us a few notes about our planes\nand operations and such things. I could use some-\nthing like that.\" Other employes have said much the\nsame thing, and probably many more have had the\nthought.\nThis is the result - a little notebook of miscellaneous\ninformation of all kinds, mostly about our company.\nSome of these facts may be brand new to you, and still\nothers may be so mossy that you've forgotten them. In\nany case, we'll wager that after reading this, you'll be\nbetter acquainted with our company.\nWe think that the mechanic said he wanted something\nlike this mainly because it might help him answer questions\nasked by people outside the industry. The mechanic could\nhandle questions about the operation of the plane, all\nright, but maybe someone stumped him by wanting to\nknow how much air express United was carrying.\nPerhaps you yourself have been cornered by someone\nwho asked about a phase of our business with which\nyou weren't very familiar.\nYou'll probably find the\nanswers on the following pages.\nWe suggest:\nNext time someone tries to embarrass you by insisting\non knowing the overall length of a 247-D, or just what\nit costs to travel by air, reach for this notebook."
