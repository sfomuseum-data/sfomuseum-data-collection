      "International Tributes to the History of Flight\nFirst Commercial SST Flight\nThe supersonic transport (SST) Tupolev TU-144,\nnamed for designer Andrei Nikolaevich Tupolev, was\nfirst unveiled by the Soviets at the 1965 Paris Air Show.\nIt underwent extensive testing between 1968 and 1975.\nThen, on December 26, 1975, the plane officially\nushered in the era of supersonic transport. A sleek\nTupolev TU-144 loaded with cargo stood poised on\nthe runway in Moscow, waiting for take-off. The flight\nwould institute twice-weekly cargo service between\nthe Soviet capital and Alma Ata, near the China bor-\nder. It was over almost as soon as it began, since the\nplane covered the distance of nearly 2,000 miles at a\ncruising speed of Mach 2.35.\nThe full-color cachet shows the Tupolev TU-144\nstreaking across the U.S.S.R. countryside on its his-\ntoric first commercial flight. The needle-nosed SST\nhad a wingspan of 94.5 feet and was powered by four\nKuznetsov 44,090-thrust turbofan engines.\nMint Stamp: The mint stamp on this Cover was issued\nby the Soviet Union in 1969. It pictures the nearly 216-\nft. long TU-144 streaking through the sky on its first\ntest flight at supersonic speed, in 1969.\nPostmark: This Cover was postmarked in Moscow,\nU.S.S.R. on December 26, 1985, the exact anniversary\nof the first commercial SST flight.\n© Postal Commemorative Society\nPrinted in U.S.A.\nW015.056.048"
