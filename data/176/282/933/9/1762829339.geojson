Moore's letter.\n\"In reply to your letter of September 15th to Colonel F. P. Lahm,\nwho is at present away from the City on a short leave of absence,\nenclosing herewith the\nsketch which you\nrequested,\ntogether with\nsome additional\ninformation on landing field requirements and an\nestimate of costs.\nAs the field stands to-day,\nthe runways - as I have placed them\nare entirely\ntoo short to accommodate all\ntypes of planes.\nIf you want\nto go into this matter in\nthe right way, the thing to do is to extend\nthe runways on out\ninto the marshy ground - making them approximately\nfifty yards wide and as far Northeast and Southeast as possible,\nbearing in mind\nthe high power lines and the fact that an obstacle at\nthe edge of\na field cuts off seven feet of runway for each obstacle\nof its own height.\nPerhaps three or four hundred feet\ncould be added\nthis way.\nAccording to the\nthe prevailing winds\nwill permit\nof landing into the Northwest and Southwest.\nAs the field is too small\nfor a runway from East to West,\nI have placed the hangars,\nshops,\netcetera,\nalong\nthe West edge of\nthe field next to the highway.\nof hard ground must be dragged and smoothed before being\nI would like to suggest\nthat if you care to look\ninto the future,\nwhen you need a much larger airport, you might consider the proposition\nof having the P. Go\nmarshland\n\u0026 E. power lines removed and filling in\nthe East, thereby\nproviding a field with a one-half mile\nrunway East and West.\nIn such event the hangars could be located on\nthe North and South side of\nthe field.\nYou would then have a sufficient\narea for every type of plane, together with a high factor of safety.\nAny telephone, telegraph, or\npower line around a field is a potential\nmenaceto landing and taking off.\""
