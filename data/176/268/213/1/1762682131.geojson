The book was inspired by vultures soaring and pelicans gliding at Stinson Beach, California, as well as by David McCulloughâ€™s superb book, The Wright Brothers.\rFLIGHT is a limited edition of 30 copies, completed in the fall of 2017.

The typeface is Adobe Garamond and the text has been printed on stained paper created with an acrylic wash. Each book contains five folded paper airplanes fitted into pop-up tabs. The tabs have been reinforced with Tyvek and the planes are printed on Hammermill 20 lb Great White 30 acid free paper. The facing pages of the accordion are printed on Coronado SST 80 lb Stipple paper and the backing pages are Graystone Classic Linen.
