      "*\n*\nGeneral Information\nPRATT and WHITNEY\nWASP AIRCRAFT ENGINE\nTHE PRATT \u0026 WHITNEY Model SICC-Wasp Aircraft motor\nis a 14 cylinder twin row radial air-cooled engine. This model engine is\nused in the twin motor Douglas DC-3 passenger plane. Power produced\nby each engine is as follows:\nMaximum Rated Horsepower...1200 Brake Horsepower\nNormal Take-Off Rating.\n1050 Brake Horsepower\nMaximum Climb Rating.\n900 Brake Horsepower\nMaximum used during cruising.. 625 Brake Horsepower\n• Gasoline consumption is approxi-\nstopped while the plane is in the air.\nmately 45 gallons per hour for each\nBoth engines and propellers rotate\nengine.\nOil consumption is approxi-\nanti-clockwise when viewed from the\nmately 1¼ quarts per hour.\nfront.\n• Total gasoline capacity of the Doug-\nlas DC-3 plane is 820 gallons. Oil ca-\npacity is 66 gallons.\nFuel consump-\ntion of the plane is approximately\ntwo miles per gallon, and the cruis-\ning range without refueling is 1800\nmiles.\nTotal weight of maximum\ngas and oil carried is 2¾ tons.\nThe\ngross weight of the Douglas plane is\n12 tons.\n• The cruising speed of the Douglas\nplane equipped with these engines and\npropellers is 190 miles per hour. Maxi-\nmum speed is 228 miles per hour. The\nplane has a service ceiling of 22,000\nfeet with full load, and can climb to\n11,000 feet with only one engine oper-\nating.\nRate of climb is 1000 feet per\nminute.\n• Hamilton standard hydromatic full\nfeathering propellers of three blade\ndesign are used with this engine. The\npitch of the blades is automatically\ncontrolled for best efficiency.\nIf de-\nsired, either engine can be instantly\n• Engines and propellers of this type\nare used in United Air Lines' Douglas\nMainliners on its coast-to-coast and\nPacific Coast routes.\nSimilar type\nengines, propellers and planes are\nused by TWA in its Transcontinental\nservices.\n8064"
