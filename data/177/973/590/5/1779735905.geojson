      "Historic First Flights of Pan American Slippers\nClipper Young America arrives in London\non the first commercial flight by the now generation\nof wide-body jets,\nfanuary 22, 1970\nMore than 350 tons of airplane, wide as a boulevard and longer by far than the Wright Brothers' first flight,\nwith a passenger capacity two and a half times that of a B707, more than 6,000 cubic feet of cargo capacity and a\ncrew of 20 - the Boeing B747 that Pan Am conceived, helped design, and introduced goes into commercial ser-\nvice.\nCommanded by Captain Robert M. Weeks, the huge B747 (N736PA) made the crossing from New York in\nsix hours and 43 minutes. The B747 incorporates the most advanced technology, including an Inertial Navigation\nSystem adapted from the Apollo Space Program that pinpoints the craft's position at all times without outside\nreferences, and a fully automatic landing system.\nAbout the Artist\nIn 1926, John T. McCoy became a working student for the Curtiss Flying Ser-\nvice, Curtiss Field, Long Island, New York.\nWhen Charles A. Lindbergh arrived at Curtiss Field, his SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS\nwas housed in one of the Curtiss hangars. It was at this time that McCoy met\nLindbergh, who was most cordial and friendly to those who worked on the flight\nline. In those days muscle power was the method used for starting engines, ac-\ncomplished by swinging the propeller by hand. McCoy often pulled a prop through\nfor Lindbergh.\nYears later, when McCoy was commissioned to do paintings depicting the\nhistory of Pan American World Airways, Inc. - entitled HISTORIC FIRST FLIGHTS\nOF PAN AMERICAN CLIPPERS - he consulted with Lindbergh on the selection of\naircraft and locations for the series.\nThis is one picture in a series of thirteen.
