Glass\nDIRECTOR\nOctober 15, 1952\nTo Friends of The Port of New York Authority:\nThis letter was carried on the first regularly scheduled helicopter air mail flight in\nthe New Jersey-New York Port District.\nThis flight from La Guardia Airport to New York International Airport to Newark\nAirport on October 15, 1952 marks the first step in the establishment of regular air mail,\nfreight, and passenger transportation by helicopter in this area. The Port of New York Authority\nwishes to take this opportunity to congratulate New York Airways, Inc., on the establishment\nof helicopter air mail service at this time and to express once more our firm belief in the future\nof the helicopter as a method of short-haul transportation.\nFor the next few months, New York Airways will operate regular helicopter air mail\nflights on a triangular route serving La Guardia, Newark, and New York International Airports.\nWhen additional equipment becomes available, the company will extend this\nsuburban points which it has been authorized to serve by the Civil Aeronautics Board.\nEventually, helicopter service will also carry cargo and passengers on these routes and on\nshuttle routes connecting Manhattan with the airports.\nWe are convinced that the helicopter can contribute greatly to the solution of the\nserious traffic problems in large metropolitan areas. Its ability to overcome surface obstacles\nand to land or take off in small places enables it to create an entirely new level of vehicular\nmovements. We are proud on the occasion of this first flight to welcome New York Airways to\nthe family of carriers serving the world's greatest regional airport system.\nPlease accept the First Flight Air Mail Cachet in which this message is enclosed\nas our memento to you on this occasion.\nHerbert O. Fisher\nChief, Aviation Development Division"
