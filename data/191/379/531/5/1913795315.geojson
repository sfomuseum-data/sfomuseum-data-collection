      "Visitors Should Know-\nDuring the Chow dynasty (1122 B. C. to 255 B. C.) three great\nphilosophers were born, Confucius, Mencius and Laotze.\nConfucius was born 551 B. C. and died 479 B. C. in his 73rd\nyear. Thus he was alive nearly two-thousand-five hundred years ago.\nHis name was K'ung Ch'in Chung-ni. K'ung is the family name,\nCh'in the personal (or what we call Christian name) and Chung-ni the\nspecial name given upon reaching full age.\nIn later years he was called K'ung Fu Tse (the appellation \"Fu Tse\"\nmeaning \"Master\"). Latinised it has become Confucius.\n*\nThe Boxer Rising took place in 1900.\nDr. Sun Yat-sen, the first President of China, took his oath of\noffice January 1, 1912. He died in Peiping (Peking) March 12, 1925.\nBuilt on the wooded slopes of Purple Mountain at Nanking is found the\nmagnificent memorial tomb to the memory of the late Statesman.\nThe Sun Yat-sen Memorial Statue and Hall at Canton is almost\nas elaborate as the tomb at Nanking.\nShih Hwang-ti, Duke of\nTsin, built the Great Wall. He came\nas a saviour of China, the only man strong enough to unite the Country,\ncontinually at war within itself, under one rule. He established the\nTsin or Chin dynasty, 221 B. C., from which China received its name.\nThe Great Wall was commenced in 214 B. C. and took only\nabout ten years to complete. It originally extended from the sea (from\nShan-hai-Khan). Thence it projected north of Peiping (Peking) to a\npoint where it assumed first a southerly, then westerly direction through\nShansi, and so along the Southern boundary of inner Mongolia to the\nYellow River.\nThe Great Wall is about 1,500 miles in length, is generally 25 ft.\nat the base and 15 ft. at the top (with intermittent towers, 40 ft. high,\nat points about 200 yards apart). It it carried over eminences sometimes\n4,000 ft. above sea level.\n233"
