      "Rodgers - 4\ncover is addressed to Miss Helen Hiseman in Honolulu; \"Hawaii\" or \"T.H.\"\nwas omitted since Rodgers was place it in the mail in Honolulu as he did\nthe other two. This lost cover also carries a manuscript notes \"Via /\nTranspific (sic) flight Favor of / Commander John Rodgers / August 31 - 25\"\nAnd of equal interest, this cover stlll contains an enclosure, in the same\nhandwriting as the address and manuscript cover note, that reads:\nHello Helen and you all. Isn't this fine to get a letter\nby air from San Francisco to Honolulu.\nCommander Rodgers\nis kind enought to take it. Love to all. Aunt Kate\nHelen Hiseman was a young girl at that time and had an interest in stampa.\nThis was not the only letter sent by\nâ€¢ via\nJohn Rodgers, to Hawaii. The recipient of the 1llustrated lost cover\nreports that another went to her cousin and that three others were sent\nto people then prominent in Honolulu - a former governor, the manager of\nWaikiki's then leading hotel, and a social leader of the Islands. The\nwhereabouts of these other lost covers is not known; undoubtedly some if\nnot all have been truly lost. But Commander John Rodgers probably carried\nat least seven covers on his 1925 flight from California to Hawaii.\nThese lost covers do differ in one way from the two recognized\nin the AAMC; these lost five were delivered through the U.S.Mail in\nHonolulu rather than being hand-delivered by Rodgers.\nInformation or comments about the lost John Rodgers covers would\nbe appreciated."
