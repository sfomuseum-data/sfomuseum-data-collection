      "CHAMPAGNE\nLaurent Pennier, Brut, 1985\nAlthough founded in 1812 Laurent Perrier only became an easily\nrecognised champagne name in the 1960's. This was due to huge\nexpansion led by its current owners, the de Nonancourt family.\nInvestment in new fermentation tanks, the purchase of substantial\nvineyards and the establishment of long term contracts with some\nof the best growers in the region have allowed the cellar master\nto establish a much respected house style.\nLaurent Perrier champagnes seem to possess a strikingly clear,\nbright taste - slightly austere yet scintillating and of\nvery reliable quality.\nOR\nCHAMPAGNE\nCharles Heidsieck\nCharles Heidsieck, Brut Millesimé,\n1985\nThe Grande Marque house of Charles Heidsieck was founded in\n1851 by the legendary \"Champagne Charlie\" - the extrovert but\nreckless Charles-Camille Heidsieck. His pioneering spirit in\nexporting his wines has ensured that Charles Heidsieck\nis known throughout the world.\nDaniel Thibault, the chefs des caves, is a master blender. His 1985\nvintage champagne is a delightful mix of Pinot and Chardonnay\ngrapes from the very best vineyard sites. It has a good, positive\ncolour, a fragrant aroma and a lovely uplifting flavour.\nSPECIA\nPECTED\nWHITE BURGUNDY\nCHABLIS GRAND CRU\nChablis Grand Cre. 1991\nWilliam Fevre\nGrand Cru Chablis has a dimension that is not apparent in other\nstyles of Chablis. It has more weight of fruit and a full bodied,\nmouth-filling flavour that defies traditional descriptions\nsuch as steely or flinty.\nWilliam Fèvre has never been afraid of submitting his wines to the\nrigours of oak ageing. He is one of, if not the, largest vineyard\nowners in the tiny Grand Cru district and this wine is a blend from\nhis vineyards within that area. A positive oaky flavour, heaps of\nfruit and the calming influence of a little bottle age\nhave produced a stunner.\nALSACE\nALSACE GRAND CRU\nПорії\nRAND DE TERCKHEIM 1989\n1989 Sewungtraminex Grand bre\n\"Brand de Turckheim\"\nDopff au Moulin\nThe Dopff family settled in the beautiful medieval town of\nRiquewihr, in the Haut-Rhin region of Alsace, in the sixteenth\ncentury and their expertise in wine-making has been\ngrowing ever since.\nThe Gewurztraminer grape is the best expression of Alsace wines\nand this, from the Grand Cru vineyard \"Brand\" above the village of\nTurckheim, is a true classic - ripe and powerful in fruit yet stylish\nand very elegant - certainly a wine to ponder.\nELECTED"
