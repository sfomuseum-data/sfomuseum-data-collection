      "First Flight of Octave Chanute's\nBiplane Glider\nJuly 27, 1896 • Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.\nUsAirmail 210\n27\n1984\n60601",
      "International Tributes to the History of Flisfit\nFirst Fligfit of Octave Chanute's Biplane Glider =\nOctave Chanute was a French-born, American edu-\ncated civil engineer, renowned as a designer of trussed\nrailroad bridges. In 1874, he became interested in\naviation and began experimenting with various the-\nories of flight. The result of his work was a biplane\nglider that combined the strength of trussed wings\nwith the aerodynamic stability of a box kite.\nChanute set up a camp on the wind-swept beach\nof Lake Michigan, near Chicago. Though in his six-\nties, he personally supervised the first test flight of\nhis craft, scheduled for July 26, 1896. High winds\nforced a postponement until the next day. But, on\nJuly 27, Chanute proved the soundness of his biplane\nglider design.\nThe full-color cachet shows one of Chanute's as-\nsociates testing the biplane glider. The truss design\nof the wings was borrowed from the engineer's rail-\nroad bridges. The same principle would later be used\nin the Wright Brothers' gliders and power aircraft.\nMint Stamp: The mint stamp on this Cover was issued\nby the United States in 1979. It pictures Octave\nChanute (1832-1910), one of the pioneers in aircraft\ndesign, and his 1896 biplane glider.\nPostmark: This Cover was postmarked in Chicago,\nIllinois, on July 27, 1984, the anniversary of the first\nflight-test of Chanute's biplane glider.\n© Postal Commemorative Society"
