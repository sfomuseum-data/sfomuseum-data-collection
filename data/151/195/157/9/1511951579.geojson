      "BE THERE!\nN902V-\nA weekend is only 2 days.\nBut try telling that to a Beechcraft owner.\nTell it to the Beechcraft owner who makes the\nski lodge before sundown Friday. He's fireside\nwith a fork in the fondue. He's not doing time\non the road.\nAnother Friday night, he's standing in the\nsand watching the surf lick at his sneakers. Not\nwatching for baggage. Not changing planes.\nA Beechcraft Bonanza saves hours and days\nof extra time. None of it whittled on the not-so-\nfreeway. None of it sandwiched between rigid\nairline schedules.\nYou get used to zipping off 400 miles in a\ncouple of hours. Fishing spots. Golf courses.\nThe big games. Distance just doesn't mean a\nthing in a fast Bonanza.\nAnd you get used to the crowd's envy when-\never your Beechcraft sweeps onto a runway. No\nother airplane has earned such respect. Because\nno other airplane comes close to a Beechcraft's\ncustom-built quality.\nCall up your Beechcraft\nDealer and he'll prove it.\nOr write us for complete details on every inch\nof every Beechcraft.\nThe sooner you do, the sooner you can cut\nloose from weekends that are over before they\nstart.\nBeechcraft\nBeech Gircraft Corporation\n9721 E.
