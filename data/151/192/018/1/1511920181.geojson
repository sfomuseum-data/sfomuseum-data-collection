To detour most weather disturbances-fly\nances. Supercharged cabins enable Stratoliners to fly\naround the weather-the Government has given TWA\nat altitudes up to 20,000 feet, from 8,000 to 16,000\npermission to fly various alternate routes. With these\nfeet, the \"altitude\" inside the cabin remains at a con-\nfacilities, there are very few days when it is impossible\nstant 8,000 feet; from 16,000 to 20,000 feet the in-\nto complete flights on either TWA's main route or its\nternal cabin \"altitude\"\ngradually increases to 12,000\noptional routes. In addition to this possibility, TWA's\nfeet, assuring passengers comfort and overweather\ngreat 4-engine Stratoliners are capable of flying over\nsmoothness in flight.\nTHINGS TO KNOW ABOUT FLYING\nSERVICE ALOFT... Your TWA hostess is anxious to\nsupply any information you wish, and to assist in making\nyour trip comfortable and enjoyable. Consult your copy\nof the service booklets carried on board, and request any\nof the available facilities from your hostess.\nENGINE SOUND ... During the course of each flight,\nchanges in the sound and \"beat\" of the motors may be\nnoticed. This is caused by the normal changing of the\nvariable pitch propellers for different rates of climb, level\nflight and descent controlled by the captain.\nIT'S GOOD FORM TO YAWN... Descending from high\naltitudes may create an ear sensation similar to that ex-\nperienced in an elevator. In TWA's Stratoliners, this may\noccur, but only during the brief period of take-off or\nlanding when the cabin super-charger is not in operation.\nBut to relieve the sensation during this period, chew\nthe\ngum supplied by your hostess and swallow often.\nOr, better yet, just open your mouth and yawn!\nRETURN TRIP RESERVATIONS... To avoid the possibility\nof all seats being sold on the day you wish to return, your\nreturn reservations should be made as soon as possible\nafter arrival at destination, or preferably before com-\nmencing your journey.

      "For\nYour Guidance\nA recent statement by the Civil Aeronautics\nBoard clarifies the position of the airlines in\nthe Nation's War Effort. There has been con-\nfusion on this subject, hence the CAB state-\nment released on May 22, 1942, is laid out\nbelow for your information and guidance.\nStatus of the Airlines\n\"The recent announcement by the War Depart-\nment made in connection with the President's\ndirective for a further coordination and integra-\ntion of domestic air transportation with the activ-\nties of the military service, illustrates the truth\nexpressed by the President on January 24, 1939,\nwhen he asserted that:\n\" \"The country's welfare in time of peace and\nits safety in time of wer rests upon * * * an\neconomically and technically sound air transporta-\ntion system?\n\"The President's recent directive contemplates\nthe transfer of a substential portion of the avail-\neble flight equipment to Army air forces to be\noperated by the various services and commands of",
      "the Army; the conversion of a substantial number\nof ships into cargo carriers to be operated by air-\nline personnel under contract for the Air Service\nCommand; and the use of the remainder of the\nequipment (about one-half of the present supply\nof the domestic lines) by the airlines in the con-\ntinuance of their regular scheduled operations;\nsubject to their availability for military missions in\nemergencies. Routes and schedules in airline oper-\nation which are not regarded as essential to the\nwar effort will be terminated to make possible the\nbighest utilization of the reduced equipment which\nis available to the airlines. Air travel vital to the\ncountry's needs will continue, subject to the\nenforcement of a strict system of priorities.\nAvailability of Service\n\"The facts as stated make clear the error in\nthe press reports of the last few days which\nannounced that operation of the airlines had\nbeen taken over by the War Department. While\nthe scheduled airline services have been limited pri-\nmarily to the war purposes and arrangements have\nbeen made for a closer adaptation of those services\nto the war needs, and while the number of schedules\nhave been substantially curtailed and in some in-\nstances routes suspended the airlines will continue\nto render service under their certificates of\npublic convenience and necessity and in accord-\nance with the regulatory authority of the Civil\nAeronautics Act.\nThe whole-hearted fashion\nin which the air carriers have cooperated witb\nthe military services in furtherance of the war\neffort has made it possible for them to continue\noperating under private management even\nthough they now constitute essentially an arm\nof the national defense.\n\"Thus, the CAB and its staff are assured that\ntheir work has become tied in more closely than\never before with the war effort. They have already\ntaken an active and major part in close cooperation\nwith the Military Director of Civil Aviation, in\nthe development and the plans for putting into\nearly effect the President's directive, and will con-\ntinue to discharge those regulatory functions pre-\nscribed by the Civil Aeronautics Act which are\neven more necessary in war than in peace.\" (Note—\nthe captions and bold italics are our own.)\nPlease note the following:\n1. The airlines continue to operate regu-\nlar schedules with equipment not\ntransferred to the Army.\n2. Air travel vital to the country's needs\nwill continue, subject to the enforce-\nment of priorities.\n3. The airlines continue their operation\nas such and have not been taken over\nby the War Department.\nWhile the airlines \"now constitute essen-\ntially an arm of the national defense,\" and\nschedules have been set up to serve essential\ntraffic flow, space available will be reserved\non request subject to priority of national de-\nfense traffic\nmovement. We suggest your\ncontinuing to call\nour reservations depart-\nment who will be happy to keep you accurately\nadvised\nconcerning availability of space on\nour schedules to all points.",

Consequently,\nthe space they have reserved cannot be released\nfor sale and the plane departs with empty\nseats.\nThis failure of\nno-show\npassengers to call-\ncel reservations presents a problem-particu-\nlarly right now when airline capacity is being\nutilized to the limit by thousands on missions\nconcerned with the nation's war effort.\nThe \"no-show\"\npassenger is not only being\nunfair to the airlines and the public but by\ndepriving another passenger of a seat, he may\nbe hampering the wartime program of the na-\ntion as well.
