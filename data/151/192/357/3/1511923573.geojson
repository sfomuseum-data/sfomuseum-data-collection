The last fiscal year's passenger traffic volume\nat the San Francisco Airport once again set a new record, with 1,307,307\npersons using the various commercial air carriers. This represents a 21.3\nper cent increase over the total of 1,077,941 passengers passing through the\nairport in 1948-49.\nAgain, a major cause of the large volume was the reduced fare air\ntransportation available through several companies to Los Angeles.\ntraffic of all kinds between these two major Pacific Coast metropolitan areas\nhas always been heavy, but the ease and convenience of an inexpensive,\ntwo-hour air trip between the cities have stimulated such travel even more.\nA significantly small increase in air carrier airplane movements, despite\ngreater passenger volumes, indicates that larger airplanes have come into\ngreater usage. As compared to a 21.3\nper cent jump in passengers, the air\ncarrier movements have gone up only 4.8 per cent. A casual visitor to the\nairport can spot this change, as there are few of the older 20-passenger\nplanes in use. Instead, the fast, 40- and 50-passenger aircraft are used, even\non some of the shortest runs.\nAir freight, a new business that has boomed spectacularly in the last\nthree years, again showed a healthy increase of 12.9 per cent over the\nprevious fiscal year. This year 31,030,680 pounds of air freight was handled\nat the airport.\nAir mail, after tailing off for several years, again is climbing.\nThe\nfiscal year saw 14,929,703 pounds handled at the field, an increase of 0.8\nper cent over the previous year.\n30",
