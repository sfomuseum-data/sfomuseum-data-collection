      "TWA's COMMITMENT\nThe most comfortable fleet\nof planes in the world.\nTWA",
      "RECEIVED\nTWA\nAMBASSADOR\nContact\nVol. II, No. 2\nEnd of Summer 1972\nA PRIVATELY CIRCULATED NEWSLETTER TO IMPORTANT BUSINESS TRAVELERS\nA MESSAGE FROM TWA'S PRESIDENT\nThe only way TWA can continue to merit your busi-\nness is to continue to improve our services. This news-\nletter and the enclosed \"Commitment\" folder discuss\nsome of our efforts.\nWe have now completely refurbished 90% of our en-\ntire U.S. and international fleet. On nearly every\nTWA plane you'll find new colors, carpets and fabrics.\nNew, overstuffed seats in first class, and our exclusive\nTwin Seat in coach.\nYou'll find coach lounges on most of our longer U.S.\nflights, and carry-on luggage compartments on most\nshorter ones.\nWe are continuing the expansion of both of our pre-\nmier flight services: Ambassador Service for long\nflights, Ambassador Express for the shorter ones, so\nthat more people in more cities can enjoy them.\nThe introduction of a new aircraft is always exciting\nfor an airline, and our L-1011 makes this especially\ntrue. This issue tells you about it, from both a pas-\nsenger's and pilot's point of view.\nThese innovations are part of TWA's commitment to\ngive you the finest service and most comfortable fleet\nof planes in the world.\nFCWiSEr\nF. C. WISER\n\"OUR PASSENGERS TOLD US WHAT THEY\nLOOK FOR IN THE 'IDEAL' AIRCRAFT, AND\nWE'RE DELIVERING IT IN THE L-1011.\"\nBLAINE COOKE\nSenior Vice President of Marketing\nIn many ways TWA's new L-1011, the newest addi-\ntion to our Ambassador Service fleet, resembles a\ncheck list of the features passengers have asked for\nor been enthusiastic about on our other aircraft.\nThis $17.5 million jet, unquestionably the most mod-\nern plane in the world, has the spaciousness of our\n747's. Nine feet separates floor and ceiling. Built to\nhold a potential capacity of 250 passengers, the L-1011\nhas been limited by TWA to a seating capacity of 206\nto enhance this spaciousness.\nIt has first class and coach lounges like our 747's and\n707's. And carry-on luggage compartments like our\n727's, so that you can bring even a full-size suitcase\nright on board with you.\nTwo-Across Coach Seating\nThere is two-across seating throughout the coach sec-\ntion, so you are never more than one seat from the\naisle. Seat backs fold forward to form consoles, and\nall armrests recess into seat backs.\nAll seats have\nTWA's lumbar support system: at the touch of a but-\nton, cushions inflate to the contour of your back. The\ncoach seat on the L-1011 is the finest seat ever put in\ncoach on any airplane.\nThe coach lounge has a fully-equipped, stand-up bar,\nand comfortable alcoves.\nThe entire first class section feels like a lounge. The\nclub chairs around tables swivel up to 270° to form\ncocktail and dining areas. Soon, we'll serve dinner\nfor four in these dining areas.\nAll meals are prepared in an automated, below-deck\ngalley. From infra-red, high-speed ovens they go up-\nstairs by special lifts to satellite service centers, and\nare served individually by flight attendants.\nThus,\nthe L-1011 achieves the unique dual advantage of\nkeeping kitchen activity out of the cabins, and reduc-\ning the need for carts in the aisles.\nThe L-1011 has more space for the things you bring\non board with you, too. In addition to the carry-on\nluggage compartments, there are self-locking over-\nhead storage compartments, and compartments for\ncoats and garment bags that disappear into the walls.\nAnd everywhere you look, you'll find this wide cabin\nimmensely pleasing to the eye.\nThe colorful seat\nfabrics and carpeting, and indirect lighting in the\nhoneycombed, sculptured ceiling, all add up to mak-\ning the L-1011 the most attractive, comfortable plane\nyou've ever flown.\nAmbassador Service Featured\nAlmost every L-1011 flight will feature TWA's popu-\nlar Ambassador Service. That means curbside bag-\ngage check-in and gate area ticketing if you prefer,\nand a Ground Ambassador in the departure lounge\nto smooth boarding and make any last-minute travel\narrangements for you."
