      "First Man On the Moon\nJuly 20, 1969 • Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S.A.\n•\nFIRST MAN ON THE MOON\nUNITED\nSTATES\n14\nCANAVER\nJUL\n20\n1984\n32920\nI",
      "International Tributes to the History of Fligft\nFirst Man On the Moon\nThere was a special air of excitement as Apollo 11\nlifted off from Cape Canaveral on July 16 with astro-\nnauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Col-\nlins aboard. This was to be the fulfillment of man's\ndream since the beginning of time. If all went well,\nArmstrong and Aldrin would walk on the moon.\nOn the afternoon of July 20, the lunar module (LM)\nEagle separated from the mother ship Columbia and\nmade its historic landing on the moon. After six hours\nof preparation, the hatch of the LM finally opened. A\nladder was lowered and Neil Armstrong climbed\ndown. At precisely 10:56 p.m., eastern time, he set\nhis boot on the surface of the moon for the first time.\nThe full-color cachet captures the remarkable mo-\nment when \"man on the moon' became a reality. It\nshows Neil Armstrong on the last rung of the ladder,\nabout to step onto the lunar surface. \"That's one\nsmall step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,\"\nhe proclaimed.\nMint Stamp: The mint stamp on this Cover was issued\nby the United States in 1969. It pictures Armstrong on\nthe moon with his life support system on his back.\nIn the background, nearly 250,000 miles away, is\nEarth.\nPostmark: This Cover was postmarked in Cape Ca-\nnaveral, Florida, U.S.A. on July 20, 1984, the exact\nanniversary of the date on which man first set foot on\nthe moon.\na Postal Comm\nSociety\nPrinted in U.S.A\n2019.056.04"
