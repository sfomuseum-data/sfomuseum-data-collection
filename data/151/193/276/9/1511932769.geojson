Kai Tak Airport\nopened in 1936 and after serving Hong Kong for more than\nsixty years, will be replaced by the new airport at Chek Lap Kok\nIn 1947, only three airlines operated through Kai Tak with a monthly total of 141 aircraft movements\nand 1,958 passengers. In 1954, as the existing terminal building was becoming congested, land\nreclamation commenced and this was followed by the construction of a runway promontory inte\nthe harbour together with a new passenger terminal. By 1969. the airport was handling approximates\n2,200 passengers each hour and with the introduction of Boeing 747 aircraft, the single runway\nwas extended in 1974 to its present length of 3,392 meters.\nIn 1997, more than 28 million passengers and 1.7 million tonnes of cargo were handled at Kai Tak,\nmore than twice the volume a decade ago. Some 67 airlines operate scheduled services each day.\nover 420 aircraft arrive or depart at a frequency of one every two minutes during peak periods\nOwing to its location in the urban area, any further expansion is severely constrained which has\nresulted in Kai Tak operating well over its design capacity. To meet the growing economic needs of\nHong kong, the Government has built a replacement airport at Chek Lap Kok, an island some\ntwenty seven kilometers to the west of Kai Tak\nSTAMP SHEETLET PRINTING DETAILS\nDEciGNse arcelamPRINTER: Ich Soschese the Netherlands\nPROCESS: Photogravure\nSHEET SIZE: 75 x 130.5 mm PERFORATION: 13.5\nPAPER: Umvatermarked\nDATE OF ISSUE: 5 July 1998\niffi\n4 893170 001351\n1949.020.003"
