      "October\n1933\nPERSONAL\nMr. H. M.\nBixby,\nPacific American Airways Company,\nRoom 411,\n3 Canton Road,\nShanghai, China.\nDear Harold:\nAs you know, during the last month we have had\nthe\npleasure of seeing a number of people who have been in contact with\nyou in China and who have been able to report to us on the situation\nover there and on your activities.\nIn short, we have been able to\nget a very good \"check up\" on you,\nand I may say frankly that we\nfeel we have all the \"lowdown\"\ndate.\nI think it only fair,\ntherefore,\nto let\nyou know\nthat these reports coming from people who have been in close con-\ntact with you recently, have been overwhelmingly favorable.\nTo\nput it briefly, we have\nbeen given very definitely and firmly to\nunderstand that if we had searched the world over for just the\nright person to handle the difficult and complicated job which was\nlaid on your shoulders, it would have been impossible to find anybody\neither better suited for it by general ability and temperament, or\nwho could have handled the situation as it developed anywhere near as\nwell as you have.\nWe have been informed, and have every reason to\nbelieve,\nthat your standing with our Chinese associates and with\nGovernment officials is not only of the best, but it is marked by\nsentiments which come very close to real affection for you on their\npart.\nA11\nthis has been duly noted, not only by your faithful\nfriend the undersigned, but also, much more important, by Mr. J. T.\nTrippe, who has\nreceived this startling news at first hand direct\nfrom the people\nconcerned, and who, I have every reason to believe,\nis satisfied of\nits accuracy.\nHe has had some very sound advice\non the Chinese\nsituation from these parties, and\ncertain important\nfacts which you had\nmade very plain in your reports, and which I had\nnot failed to call to his attention, have been even further impressed\nupon him.\nabove, for your\npersonal information, may serve as\nsome slight encouragement in the midst of your trials.\nAnyway I hope\nyou will appreciate\nthat we are all pulling for you and, far from being\ndisposed to\nbe\ncritical, are most sympathetic with your difficulties\nand\nwell\nsatisfied\nwith\nwhat you have succeeded in accomplishing so far.\nWith kindest regards.\nSincerely yours,\nSumogan\nSWM: FP 3"
