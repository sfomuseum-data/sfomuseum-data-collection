      "The Chef\nthe\n\"Day\nFIRST CLASS\nSABENA\nBELGIAN WORLD AIRLINES",
      "Pens Hoffyn\nA kint of autumn in the air\nSeasonal treats in store for top-class tastebuds\nCooking is in René Stoffyn's blood. The Belgian\nmaster-chef is the fifth checking generation of his family\nto satisfy the palates of customers at their restaurant Le\nCentenaire, just down the road from the celebrated\nBrussels landmark the Atomium. This month, Stoffyn\ntakes over a three-month stint supervising meals served\nto First and Business Class passengers on outbound\nSabena flights to Tokyo and Johannesburg, and return\njourneys from New York.\nStoffyn is accustomed to catering for people at the\ntop. Over the years, Le Centenaire has been patronised\nby many celebrities, among them Jane Birkin, Charles\nAznavour, Coluche, Billy Ocean, and Gérard Depardieu.\nFor his spell as Sabena's guest Maître Cuisinier,\nStoffyn has devised a series of unique autumn menus for\nthe three long-haul routes, ranging from between-meal\nsnacks to gourmet dinners, served inflight on porcelain\nplates with white table linen. Among the mouthwatering\ndishes Stoffyn has dreamed up, to make each journey\na memorable experience, are duck wings cooked in Kriek\nbeer with black cherry sauce, and\nvenison cutlets\nflavoured with autumn herbs, all to be accompanied by\na carefully-chosen selection of fine vintage wines.\nThese special menus have been many months in the\nplanning. \"Haute cuisine is a bit like haute couture,\"\nsays Stoffyn with a smile. \"You have to work a season\nin advance.\" The Belgian chef even flew across the\nAtlantic, to advise catering staff who prepare Sabena's\nmeals on the New York-Brussels route. The cuisine, he\nexplains, is \"two thirds traditional French, one third\nmodern and innovative.\"\nStoffyn says he has enjoyed the challenge of planning\nmeals for Sabena passengers. \"It is completely different\nfrom ordinary catering. You have to formulate a menu\naccording to what is possible on board. For example, a\nsauce Bearnaise is out because it has to be prepared just\nbefore serving, otherwise it goes sour.\"\nAnd he adds that inflight diners can be even more\ndemanding than those down on the ground. \"People pay\nmore attention to what they eat when they are aboard\na plane, because they have nothing else to do.\""
