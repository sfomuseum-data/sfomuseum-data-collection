I have discovered that out of\nsimplicity\n-using fresh ingredients,\nsubtle dressings and classic sauces-\ncome the best and most pleasing\ndishes. A few thoughtfully chosen\nflavors can combine to create a\ndistinctive and enjoyable repast.\nWe have worked to develop a selection\nthat will bring you the satisfaction of\nprofessional culinary artistry and the\ncontentment of a home-cooked meal.\nUnited Airlines and I are delighted to\noffer you today's menu, and hope you\nwill take this opportunity to sit back\nand enjoy some of the finer things in\nlife-good food, good conversation and\na great flight with United Airlines.\njacques\nJacques Pépin\nMaster Chef\nTO BEGIN\nChilled salmon presented with a fennel and mustard seed salad\nMAIN COURSE\nLamb chops Provençal with a red pepper sauce\nBaked with a breaderumb and mustard crust,\ncomplemented by dill gnocchi and a vegetable nori\nfeaturing sweet potatoes, parsnips and leeks\nSautéed turkey piccata in a lemon caper sauce\nTopped with herbs and Parmesan cheese,\naccompanied by sautéed spinach with nutmeg\nand yellow rice with orange rind\nSeared fillet of salmon enhanced by basil tomato sauce\nComplemented by steamed bok choy\nand Parisienne potatoes with parsley\nThe above entrees are accompanied by a garden fresh salad\nwith Parmesan pepper or Asian sesame ginger dressing\nPan-seared yellowfin tuna served atop baby spinach greens\nAccompanied by ruby red grapefruit, Roma tomatoes\nand Javanese dressing, offered with a fruit appetizer\nDESSERT\nIce cream sundae\nBEN\u0026JERRY'S Vanilla and Chocolate ice cream\naccompanied by hot fudge sauce, wafer and whipped cream\nSTARBUCKS. coffee will be available throughout the flight.\nCrystal Geyser Natural Alpine Spring Water\nPRIOR TO ARRIVAL\ncookies warm from the oven\n2006.059.301.077"
