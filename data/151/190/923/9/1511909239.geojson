      "SEE ALL\nTHE ISLANDS OF HAWAI\nTo most first-time visitors, Hawaii is more than a land of dreams-\ncome-true; it is a land of innumerable happy surprises.\nOne such surprise, for some, is to learn that Hawaii is not just one\nisland, but a lovely chain of islands, each differing from the others\nin size, geographical features, attractions and things to do.\nEven more surprising to many is to find that bustling, exciting Hono-\nlulu and Waikiki, on the Island of Oahu, are not the be-all and\nend-all of Hawaii. Rather, they are the gateway to another, more\nleisured, more charming, infinitely more interesting Hawaii which\nlies invitingly close at hand, on the friendly Neighbor Islands.\nAn understanding of these facts is the key to full enjoyment of\nyour visit to Hawaii. Turn this magic key yourself — with a pleasant,\nscenic flight by Hawaiian Airlines to any of the Neighbor Islands.\nOnce you have opened this door part way, you will want to swing\nit wide!\nTHE ISLAND OF HAWAII. Largest and southernmost island in the\ngroup, Hawaii offers greater scenic variety and more striking con-\ntrasts than any of the others. Here you may see, at close range and\nin perfect safety, intermittently active Kilauea Volcano, the chain of\ncraters, lava tubes and tree fern forests which are part of Hawaii\nVolcanoes National Park. From the palm-fringed shores of Hilo Bay,\nyour gaze will take in cane fields — and the lofty peaks of Mauna\nKea and Mauna Loa, snow-capped in winter. Nearby is the remark-\nable Black Sand Beach of Kalapana. Across the island from Hilo, the\nhistoric Kona Coast beckons game fishermen, antiquarians and all\nwho know the joys of full and perfect relaxation.\nTHE ISLAND OF MAUI is actually two islands joined together by\na fertile peninsula, where modern suburbs adjoin broad fields of\nwaving sugar cane. Maui's eastern \"half\" is a massive volcanic peak\n— majestic, 10,000-foot Haleakala, legendary home of Hawaii's Sun\nGod. Haleakala National Park embraces the vast, long-dormant sum-\nmit crater, 20 miles in circumference and 2,000 feet from rim to\ncrater floor. At Maui's eastern tip is the lushly beautiful resort dis-\ntrict of Hana, served exclusively by Hawaiian Airlines on scheduled\nflights. West Maui's attractions include lao Valley and its famed\n\"Needle,\" the historic whaling town of Lahaina, rich in legends of\nroyalty and roistering, and the new Kaanapali resort area with its\nsuperb beaches and championship golf course.\nTHE ISLAND OF KAUAI, often called the Garden Island, is con-\nsidered by many the most beautiful of all. Legendary home of the\nmenehunes, Hawaii's \"Little Men,\" Kauai's mystical cloak of things-\nthat-were adds enchantment to its very modern things-that-are.\nPopular scenic spots on Kauai are spectacularly colorful Waimea\nCanyon; the lovely Fern Grotto on Wailua River; exquisite Hanalei\nValley on the northern shore, and beaches so beautiful that movie\nproducers regularly film them for \"South Sea\" settings. Excellent\nresort hotels and sporty golf add to Kauai's attractions.\nTHE ISLANDS OF MOLOKAI AND LANAI are the smallest of the\n\"main islands\" of the group and least known to visitors. Goat and\ndeer hunting, in season, are good in the rugged mountains of Molo-\nkai's eastern end. Lanai, privately owned and devoted almost exclu-\nsively to pineapple culture, displays a model agricultural community\nin an exotic setting. Both islands are served daily by Hawaiian Airlines,\neither flight taking just over 20 minutes from Honolulu Airport.\nFLY HAWAIIAN\nHOLDER OF THE WORLD'S SAFETY RECORD"
