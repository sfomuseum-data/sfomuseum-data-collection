      "Americas First Balloon Ascent\nJanuary 9, 1793 • Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.\nHot air ballooning\nUSA\n20c\nJAN\n9\n1984\n19104\n8",
      "International Tributes to the History of Flisht\nAmericas First Balloon Ascent.\nOn the morning of January 9, 1793, a large crowd of\nanxious spectators gathered behind Independence\nHall in Philadelphia. Among them was the President\nof the United States, George Washington. They had\ncome to witness a moment of history, the first bal-\nloon ascent in America.\nAt 10:00 a.m., Jean-Pierre Blanchard, dressed in a\nplain blue suit and a cocked hat with white feathers,\nlifted off. He covered some 15 miles before coming\ndown in Woodbury, New Jersey. Then, aided by a\nhandwritten letter of introduction from Washington,\nBlanchard found his way back to Philadelphia. Resi-\ndents of that city gave him a hero's welcome.\nThe full-color cachet portrays the moment of take-\noff, as it was described in detail the following day by\nThe Federal Gazette and Philadelphia Daily Advertiser.\nMint stamp: The mint stamp on this Cover was issued\nby the United States in 1983 to commemorate the\n200th anniversary of manned flight. It pictures color-\nful modern sport balloons, typically made of nylon or\npolyester, which are filled with hot air.\nPostmark: This Cover was postmarked in Philadel-\nphia, Pennsylvania on January 9, 1984, the anniver-\nsary of the first balloon ascent in America.\n© Postal Commemorative Society\nPrinted in U.S.A.\n1015.054.004"
