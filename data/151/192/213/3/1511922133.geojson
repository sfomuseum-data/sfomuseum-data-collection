      "Mistoric First Flights of Pan American Clippers\nPan American's first passenger flight\nKey Nest, Florida, to Mavana, Cuba,\nfanuary 16, 1928\nSeven passengers board a Pan American Fokker F-7 (NC53), inaugurating scheduled United States-flag\ncommercial passenger service between Key West and Havana, a distance of 90 miles. The trimotor, high-wing\nmonoplane was commanded by Captain Hugh I. Wells. A sister ship flown by Captain Edwin C. Musick took off a\nfew minutes earlier, carrying mail and cargo to Havana.\nThis passenger flight was one of Pan American's many aviation 'firsts.' It was preceded by the inauguration\nof airmail service to Havana on October 28, 1927, Pan Am's first flight and the first scheduled international flight\nby an American airline.\nAbout the Artist\nIn 1926, John T. McCoy became a working student for the Curtiss Flying Ser-\nvice, Curtiss Field, Long Island, New York.\nWhen Charles A. Lindbergh arrived at Curtiss Field, his SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS\nwas housed in one of the Curtiss hangars. It was at this time that McCoy met\nLindbergh, who was most cordial and friendly to those who worked on the flight\nline. In those days muscle power was the method used for starting engines, ac-\ncomplished by swinging the propeller by hand. McCoy often pulled a prop through\nYears later, when McCoy was commissioned to do paintings depicting the\nhistory of Pan American World Airways, Inc. - entitled HISTORIC FIRST FLIGHTS\nOF PAN AMERICAN CLIPPERS - he consulted with Lindbergh on the selection of\naircraft and locations for the series.\nThis is one picture in a series of thirteen. If you would like to purchase 8½\" × 11\"\nor 16\" x 20\" limited edition prints, send your letter of inquiry to: Public Relations\nDepartment - Pan American World Airways, Inc., Pan Am Building, New York, New\nYork 10166.
