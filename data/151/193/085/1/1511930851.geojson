      "ROSCOE\nTURNE\nR\nEstablishing a new transcontinental record of thirteen hours\nand thirty-five minutes in his flight from the east to the west\ncoast, Colonel Roscoe Turner cut two hours and seventeen\nminutes from the previous mark. His Wasp Junior powered\nWedell-Williams Special averaged approximately two hundred\nmiles an hour for the two thousand five hundred miles separating\nLos Angeles from New York.\nStrong head winds on the\noccasion of his flight retarded him tremendously.\nNotwith-\nstanding this, however, his record stands as one of the most\noutstanding of the year. Renowned as one of America's premier\nspeed pilots, Colonel Turner has flown more than a quarter\nmillion miles behind Pratt and Whitney engines.\nThe implicit\nconfidence which he has placed in them has always been\njustified. His records stand as evidence of their performance.\nA ME\nHAIZ LIP\nBy outmarking all entries in his speed dash from Los Angeles\nto Cleveland Jimmie Haizlip won the Bendix Trophy for 1932.\nNot satisfied with this achievement alone, he continued on to\nNew York, and by clipping fifty-seven minutes from the previous\nrecord he established a new transcontinental west to east mark\nof ten hours and nineteen minutes.\nFrom coast to coast in\nless than a half day and traveling at an average speed of two\nhundred and forty-two miles an hour is the grueling test to\nwhich his Wasp Junior was placed.\nAt altitudes ranging\nfrom sea level to eighteen thousand feet and through a range of\ncorresponding temperatures every throb of its mechanical heart\nwas registered with unending precision.\nAchievements of this\nnature bespeak praise for pilot, plane and engine.\nThey are ef-\nfected only through the perfection and coordination of all three."
